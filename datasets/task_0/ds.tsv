I've been on the medication about a month. I mean, I wasn't expecting happy daisies and roses and unicorns out my butt soon after taking it, but I can't tell if the way I feel is because the medicine isn't the right medicine, or if it really is everything else. :/ Definitely a really awkward place to be. Especially because if I break up with my boyfriend, he'd have to move back in with his parents across the country (U.S.) and that would be it for us. No real chance of reconciliation.	i ve been on the medication about a month i mean i wasn t expecting happy daisies and roses and unicorns out my butt soon after taking it but i can t tell if the way i feel is because the medicine isn t the right medicine or if it really is everything else annoyed definitely a really awkward place to be especially because if i break up with my boyfriend he d have to move back in with his parents across the country u.s. and that would be it for us no real chance of reconciliation 	0.0026	0.0	97	1

"My boyfriend wants to kill himself. He has been suicidal for over 7 years, since before we met. He has been in therapy for years, inpatient and outpatient, tried out a lot of drugs, was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. He has made an attempt before we became a couple, said that he could not go through with it because of me. We've been together for 4.5 years now. There have been good days, but the majority were bad. We talked a lot. That is one good thing, I guess, like he puts it ""our metacommunication is outstanding"". He is a psych student, ironically. He explained his feelings of vanity in deep. I listened and tried to help. Was compassionate, held him when he cried, tried to make anything going for him, helped him through assignments and work, when he had given up on it. And I understood. I am mentally ill myself. I've had suicidal thoughts when I was younger, still fight with self-harm. I really understand how this world can seem meaningless. I found my purpose and goals. And I really tried to help him find his. I also tried to save him in some more practical ways which included physically fighting him to prevent him from harming himself (I am not sure about the rules here so I wont go into detail) in a mental state where he has no other goals. He does not remember these episodes. I don't know if he is able to be happy. I mean happy in a sustained way, longer than a few hours or a day. I feel like he might be if he had a better girlfriend. Because there is one need of him I am failing to fulfil... I can't give him what he sexually wants. (I could explain that further, but I think it is enough to say that he can only enjoy it if I enjoy it. And that is something I fail to feel or act accordingly). This is quite hard on him, despite the depression his sex drive always has been quite strong. He is often mean to me. Cold sometimes. Angry. Saying that he'll never have real sex in his life. Telling me that I study too much, that I am not really interested to him... I proposed to open the relationship, help him find a new girlfriend, pay a prostitute... he does not want that. He wants me. And I already gave him everything, so many free days and evenings, I gave him years of myself. And with some of the sexual things he wanted - my dignity. Then he is nice again. This almost hurts more that him being mean, because then I see what I am scared to loose. He says that it is not my fault, that I am not responsible for his life or his eventual suicide. I used to abstain from bringing my own feelings into this arguments (""I will be sad if you die""). I tried to find a way for him to see meaning in his life. One time he said that he basically repeated the discussions with his former therapist with me. Lately I've come to the point where I repeatedly told him, that I don't want to be a murderer. Because that how I'd feel like if he killed himself. He died because I was not good enough. I know from a rational point of view that this is probably not true (though the sex dynamic changes things a bit). And that all of this is not about me, he is the one whos life is in danger... I am a medical student and asked a psych professor what to do if a patient has gone through many treatments and still wants to kill himself. His answer was: ""Sometimes we can't do anything to prevent a suicide."" He had no idea what he told me there... how it hurt. No one has any idea. My boyfriends former psychiatrist (I'll call him Dr. R.) was the only one who knew. He actually told my boyfriend that if he can't prevent it, he was ready to help my boyfriend anyway, support him while he is still alive. Dr. R understood. He was so relived when I emailed him, relieved that someone hat established a rapport with my boyfriend, that my boyfriend had let someone come close to him. That was right in the beginning of our relationship. Inpatient treatment followed (after I had convinced my boyfriend to try it). Dr. R. retired 2 years ago. I miss him. He was the only one beside me knowing and truly understanding my boyfriend. And the only one understanding what I have been going through. On good days I manage to do everything my boyfriend wants. And he is happy, has a thousand ideas, cuddles... On bad days he says that I am sadistic because I am keeping him alive. He asks me over and over to let him kill himself. And I am scared that at some point I'll say yes. So all of this ends. I'd never have to have sex again. I'd have time, I would be free in my decisions. I am not a good person. _____________ Thank you for reading. I don't know if I'll be able to reply to eventual answers... But I'd really appreciate your advice on my situation. EDIT: Reading the titles of the other posts I remembered something: he has extremely important exams in June. I don't know if I can do anything if he fails them. That will probably be the end. **EDIT2: Thank you for your answers. I am sorry that I did not reply individually...

When you say you woke up and had to recall who the people in your house were, was it as extreme as having no memory of them at all or did you just feel strange and out of place, like it only just 'clicked' that each of them were members of your family? If you had memory loss and that still happens these days then you *need* to get it checked out. If its the latter though, I still occasionally feel like I'm half in my body and half out of it and everything seems out of place. You shouldn't worry about that too much. Life can be pretty tough, believe me I've been through some shit. When you have real overwhelming depression the very concept of changing yourself and making your life better seems like an impossible task- I'm at college too and in darker times I've had days when I could barely make it out of bed and to the fridge to feed myself, as pathetic as that sounds, but the first step to recovering from a slump is to forgive yourself for any bad choices you have made and any time you felt too weak to make a change. You didn't gain any interests as a little kid, you never had a relationship, you feel like you are not in control of your life? That's ok! The past is the past, there's not a person alive who doesn't regret not doing a few things differently. As well as forgiving your past mistakes you need to be fully aware that there are some things you have control over. The very fact that somewhere deep down you would *like* to change is the biggest hurdle in many ways. Depending on your circumstances and how much motivation you can find you can alter your life more slowly or quickly, just try to do something rather than nothing. The 'no zero days' post on reddit really helped me (look it up!) I found that the biggest flaw with most motivational techniques is that they can pump you up and make you want to change the world but that feeling burns out pretty damn fast. The key is baby steps, make a little change each week and stick to it. This time next year you will have completely reshaped yourself. So what can you do? Your mood is crap, you don't like the fact you are skinny and you'd like to find yourself a girl? Working out is a pretty decent remedy for all of these things. I'm not saying you should run out of the door now and sign up at your nearest gym. Just commit to doing some exercise. Whatever you are comfortable with- 10 push ups and crunches each morning before you shower, go out for a real short run after you get up. And slowly increase this. Think about your diet too, what you put into your body makes all the difference when it comes to your mood and appearance (again, baby steps, but stick with it). Take a full body picture before you start, take it today even, and then you can always look back on it and see how far you came. You work six days each week, that leaves the occasional day off. Do *something* with it. Its important that you rest when you can but if you want more of a social life then go for it- call up old friends, join a club, ask people if they'd like to hang out that day. Find something to live for and look forward to that day. Similarly try to structure your daily routine so you have an hour or two each night to chill out, no excuses, you work extremely hard and you deserve that. Thirdly, take some time to find direction. It doesn't matter what it is. A job you would like to do, a business you would like to start, a home you would like to have. Anything that you could aim for that would make your life a happier one. If you don't want to be a software engineer- fine. There are literally millions of people with degrees unrelated to the field they end up excelling in. The fact that you have a degree in a respected subject will help you, and the skills you learn may well become useful later down the road. Very few people know what they truly want to do in college, don't worry about that. For anything you absolutely can't change, just keep in mind that everything will eventually pass. You have to struggle through college with no free time? In a couple of years college will be over. All you have to do is wait, your circumstances will change and you'll have a lot of free time to fill with any wild post-college plans you make now! You have it rough, its understandable that you feel like you have a terrible life but I believe in you. I know you are going to get better, we don't know each other but I am counting on you to do something here. Plus, you may not realize it but you have a few really great weapons in your arsenal. You are nineteen for a start, you have barely begun. You could count the number of years in which you have actually had some major decision-making-control over your life on one hand. There is so much time for you to alter your course, just start now and you can absolutely do pretty much anything you set your mind to. You still have both of your parents- I'm 21 and have no real family around me, I know that you can use them somehow, even just for a shoulder to lean on now and then. You're in college, that puts you ahead of most people educationally. You have work experience that is going to look really good on your resume. It may seem like its all just a drag but take whatever you can from every shitty experience you have. If there's one thing I've learnt from my years with depression its that no one's life is as good as it looks to the outside world, never compare yourself to others because its very rare that anyone is willing to reveal their dark side. Hey, if you looked me up on facebook you'd probably think I have a pretty awesome life. I'm at an ivy league university, have a few pictures of me hanging out drinking with friends and spent the last summer break travelling around the world with my girlfriend. Months later my depression was triggered badly and I couldn't leave my apartment, was self harming and came close to suicide. During that time I found out that a good buddy of mine was also self harming and extremely stressed from the workload. I recently took a psychology class where we did an anonymous test for depression and eating disorders. In our ivy league class of supposedly successful students over three quarters gave results that indicated moderate to severe depression and around fifteen per cent were classed as having an eating disorder. Don't sweat. I know that you are going to come out of this a great person. If you need anything at all feel free to PM me, I'm not on reddit as often as I'd like but I'll always get back to you.	when you say you woke up and had to recall who the people in your house were was it as extreme as having no memory of them at all or did you just feel strange and out of place like it only just clicked that each of them were members of your family ?

"Perhaps I can help you. I don't want to make any assumptions, but if I understand you correctly, you don't want to die; you want to get better. Death to you would be an unfortunate if possibly necessary escape from a crippling depression. I've been there mate. I really have. But clearly, your counselor has not. When I was first diagnosed depressed, I had the world's dumbest counselor. It's natural to be disgusted by them. I'm disgusted for you. There is ONE most important trait in the person who will shepherd you through this disease until you have the tools and/or medication to handle it yourself: understanding. Trust your instincts. If he doesn't understand you, tell him to piss off and move on. If I had to make a bet right now as to whether you'd make it, I'd put money that you do. Statistically, you have all the traits of someone who makes it: empathy, transparency, effective communication even just through text and to total strangers, and most of all the absolutely critical self-reflection that will push you forward on your road to recovery. I can give you the tools, but I can't use them for you. 1) Get help (and probably medicine). In my experience, the hotlines have been worse than useless, much like your counselor. Our country's system is great at emergencies, and terrible long-term. Please, call them when things get bad. They really can help when there is nothing left. For longer term help, consider getting a dog. A big furry one. I was once just like you. I too once said that I've regretted every decision I've ever made. I do not regret getting a dog. She saved my life every day for the most critical three years. Which human can you rely on emotionally? If you have none, get one. Pay for a therapist. A good one. One who understands you and has time to take care of your illness, just like you would pay for a surgeon if you had cancer. Confront the inherent denial. You and I both know that you're counselor isn't equipped for somebody like you. If you had cancer, you wouldn't give up just because your surgeon was being stupid, no matter how much daily pain you were in. Remember, I'm not faulting you. Nobody should have to go through what you're going through. Depression is an extremely personal enemy, the kind that knows your every weakness and how to exploit them. You're probably wondering what right I have to suggest that you go on living this hell indefinitely on a vague promise of a future cure. In fact, I'm willing to bet you've been feeling this way long enough that you can't even remember what cured feels like. And you would be absolutely correct. It would be sadistic of me to make you live an agonizing life alone, waiting to get better. So let me flip the premise: what if you had a goal? What if you only had to live long enough until you knew everything about your depression? Is that so unreasonable? If you had cancer, wouldn't you want to understand it enough to know it were incurable before you killed yourself? Consider the difference of perspective between the two premises. One is about waiting; the other exploring. One is about suffering; the other about observing, understanding. One relies on pedantic platitudes to limit choice; the other leaves the suicide option on the table. And most importantly, one will kill you; the other will get you through this. 2) Train yourself to understand your pain. If you are going to live long enough to at least understand the way your mind works, you're going to need some effective, tested strategies to make it through the tough times, until you are absolutely confident that there is nothing left for you to do. And trust me, bud, there will be tough times. But I can teach you how to master your pain. Here is the exercise. Set a timer for one hour, with a soothing alarm, like chimes or bells, nothing too jarring. Go into a reasonably quiet room. Sit cross legged on the floor. Get up against a wall or something to support your back. Start the timer and close your eyes. DO NOT MOVE. This is extremely important. Don't scratch if you have an itch. Don't wiggle when your bottom hurts. Don't move your arms when they feel weird. Don't even move your tongue. The only motions allowed are those required to breathe. Does this sound unreasonable? It is. Too bad. Depression is unreasonable. Is it going to hurt? Yes, a ton. By 50 minutes it's going to hurt like a motherfucker. Don't stop. You can't tell depression to stop hurting when it gets to be too much. But I can give you the secret to master the pain. The secret is in your mind. Think about what you're thinking about and then think about your breathing instead. If you start thinking about elephants, here's what you do: ""Elephants are really great."" - ""I just had a thought."" - ""Breathe in. Breathe out."" Do not stop. Don't cheat. Your depression knows the difference. Your life literally depends on it. What does this accomplish? First it trains your willpower. Beating depression means beating pain. It means doing the exact opposite of what every fiber of your body is demanding that you do. Secondly, it makes you more aware of what you're thinking about. You will need to know this when you're analyzing the cycles of thoughts that go through your head. What doesn't this accomplish? Consider a situation that happened to me a billion times. I'm sitting cross-legged when, instead of a thought about elephants, I get this thought: ""You're not gonna make it."" These thoughts, mantras, chants, whatever you want to call them, are extremely common in depressive thought cycles. You described your mind chanting ""I want to die"" repeatedly. I know exactly what that feels like. Do not fall into this very easy trap: ""I want to die"" - ""I'm thinking about wanting to die again"" - ""Why am I thinking about wanting to die"" - ""Well I'm thinking that way because I have no hope."" - ""Why don't I have hope"" and on and on and on ad infinitum. This is the correct way to handle this: ""I want to die."" - ""I just thought about wanting to die."" - ""Breathe in. Breathe out."" I'm not asking you to ignore or invalidate those feelings. I'm asking you to log them away for a later exercise. This exercise is not about deep thinking. It's about meta thinking, being in control about what you think about. Lastly, do not fall into the very easy trap of punishing yourself for thinking. Remember, its not ""I want to die"" - ""I just thought about wanting to die"" - ""Damn I screwed up by thinking"" - ""Damn I did it again"" - ""Stop I'm losing focus on my breathing"" - ""Damn I did it again"" and on and on. There is no failure for thinking: this is inevitable. There is only the willpower to resist the temptation to continue ignoring your breathing. 3) Develop personal strategies to combat the cycle of depression. Use what you learned from the last exercise to understand how your depression works. For example, I learned that I was truly physically tired. I would stay up late crying all night. Then I would be exhausted all day and have a terrible day. Then I'd feel bad about a terrible day and cry all night. And on and on and on. Your depression has cycles that can be demystified, identified, evaluated, and fought against. But you can't beat an enemy you don't understand, so you absolutely must identify what you're fighting against. What are your triggers? Social situations? Your romantic life? Stress? Money? Anger? Regret? Are you creatively in a rut? Are you struggling to find a purpose? Most likely its just this: you have regular people problems intensified by an order of magnitude by your disease. In my case, I was struggling with the aftermath of a sexual assault. A common problem made a billion times worse because depression knows how to twist it into a wound that hurts every time. So any time I was even remotely bullied, it would feel like I was being victimized all over again. Here's my advice: Identify your triggers and develop strategies to cope with them until you can medically fix your depression. What strategies work? Magic Potion Mix a drop of food coloring in some water. Label the container, magic anti-depression potion. Guzzle the potion as fast as you can. I know it sounds crazy, but I swear it makes me feel better. Throw your depression into the sea Get a rock. Channel all that negative depression juju into that rock. Throw the rock into the sea. I know the rock isn't the depression, but for some reason the physical act of flinging the badness away from you makes you feel physically further away from your disease. Fuzz Therapy Cuddle a dog, cat, little sister. Don't have one? Go on the internet and look up pictures of baby seals. Remember, people like you and me spend a lot of our lives being sad. So much so that we often feel like we have no power over how we feel. But its not true. Even if its just for a second, you can change the way you feel. (One quick caveat, perhaps something you have already noticed. Depressed people like you and me don't have the same reaction to baby seals that other people do. Mostly, it makes us cry really hard for reasons we don't quite understand. This is positive. Crying is not bad. Feeling bad is bad. Crying is great. It helps us vent out that pain. Don't be alarmed if its not immediately joyful to look at cute animals on the internet. But do remember that you are causing yourself to have a different emotional reaction.) Take a walk around the block. Throw yourself a celebration when you make it all the way around."	perhaps i can help you i don t want to make any assumptions but if i understand you correctly you don t want to die you want to get better death to you would be an unfortunate if possibly necessary escape from a crippling depression i ve been there mate i really have but clearly your counselor has not when i was first diagnosed depressed i had the world s dumbest counselor it s natural to be disgusted by them i m disgusted for you there is one most important trait in the person who will shepherd you through this disease until you have the tools and or medication to handle it yourself understanding trust your instincts if he doesn t understand you tell him to piss off and move on if i had to make a bet right now as to whether you d make it i d put money that you do statistically you have all the traits of someone who makes it empathy transparency effective communication even just through text and to total strangers and most of all the absolutely critical self reflection that will push you forward on your road to recovery i can give you the tools but i can t use them for you get help and probably medicine in my experience the hotlines have been worse than useless much like your counselor our country s system is great at emergencies and terrible long term please call them when things get bad they really can help when there is nothing left for longer term help consider getting a dog a big furry one i was once just like you i too once said that i ve regretted every decision i ve ever made i do not regret getting a dog she saved my life every day for the most critical three years which human can you rely on emotionally ? if you have none get one pay for a therapist a good one one who understands you and has time to take care of your illness just like you would pay for a surgeon if you had cancer confront the inherent denial you and i both know that you re counselor isn t equipped for somebody like you if you had cancer you wouldn t give up just because your surgeon was being stupid no matter how much daily pain you were in remember i m not you nobody should have to go through what you re going through depression is an extremely personal enemy the kind that knows your every weakness and how to exploit them you re probably wondering what right i have to suggest that you go on living this hell indefinitely on a vague promise of a future cure in fact i m willing to bet you ve been feeling this way long enough that you can t even remember what cured feels like and you would be absolutely correct it would be sadistic of me to make you live an agonizing life alone waiting to get better so let me flip the premise what if you had a goal ? what if you only had to live long enough until you knew everything about your depression ? is that so unreasonable ? if you had cancer wouldn t you want to understand it enough to know it were incurable before you killed yourself ? consider the difference of perspective between the two premises one is about waiting the other exploring one is about suffering the other about observing understanding one relies on pedantic platitudes to limit choice the other leaves the suicide option on the table and most importantly one will kill you the other will get you through this train yourself to understand your pain if you are going to live long enough to at least understand the way your mind works you re going to need some effective tested strategies to make it through the tough times until you are absolutely confident that there is nothing left for you to do and trust me bud there will be tough times but i can teach you how to master your pain here is the exercise set a timer for one hour with a soothing alarm like chimes or bells nothing too jarring go into a reasonably quiet room sit cross legged on the floor get up against a wall or something to support your back start the timer and close your eyes do not move this is extremely important don t scratch if you have an itch don t wiggle when your bottom hurts don t move your arms when they feel weird don t even move your tongue the only motions allowed are those required to breathe does this sound unreasonable ? it is too bad depression is unreasonable is it going to hurt ? yes a ton by minutes it s going to hurt like a motherfucker don t stop you can t tell depression to stop hurting when it gets to be too much but i can give you the secret to master the pain the secret is in your mind think about what you re thinking about and then think about your breathing instead if you start thinking about elephants here s what you do elephants are really great i just had a thought breathe in breathe out do not stop don t cheat your depression knows the difference your life literally depends on it what does this accomplish ? first it trains your willpower beating depression means beating pain it means doing the exact opposite of what every fiber of your body is demanding that you do secondly it makes you more aware of what you re thinking about you will need to know this when you re analyzing the cycles of thoughts that go through your head what doesn t this accomplish ? consider a situation that happened to me a billion times i m sitting cross legged when instead of a thought about elephants i get this thought you re not gonna make it these thoughts mantras chants whatever you want to call them are extremely common in depressive thought cycles you described your mind chanting i want to die repeatedly i know exactly what that feels like do not fall into this very easy trap i want to die i m thinking about wanting to die again why am i thinking about wanting to die well i m thinking that way because i have no hope why don t i have hope and on and on and on ad infinitum this is the correct way to handle this i want to die i just thought about wanting to die breathe in breathe out i m not asking you to ignore or invalidate those feelings i m asking you to log them away for a later exercise this exercise is not about deep thinking it s about meta thinking being in control about what you think about lastly do not fall into the very easy trap of punishing yourself for thinking remember its not i want to die i just thought about wanting to die damn i screwed up by thinking damn i did it again stop i m losing focus on my breathing damn i did it again and on and on there is no failure for thinking this is inevitable there is only the willpower to resist the temptation to continue ignoring your breathing develop personal strategies to combat the cycle of depression use what you learned from the last exercise to understand how your depression works for example i learned that i was truly physically tired i would stay up late crying all night then i would be exhausted all day and have a terrible day then i d feel bad about a terrible day and cry all night and on and on and on your depression has cycles that can be identified evaluated and fought against but you can t beat an enemy you don t understand so you absolutely must identify what you re fighting against what are your triggers ? social situations ? your romantic life ? stress ? money ? anger ? regret ? are you creatively in a rut ? are you struggling to find a purpose ? most likely its just this you have regular people problems intensified by an order of magnitude by your disease in my case i was struggling with the aftermath of a sexual assault a common problem made a billion times worse because depression knows how to twist it into a wound that hurts every time so any time i was even remotely bullied it would feel like i was being victimized all over again here s my advice identify your triggers and develop strategies to cope with them until you can medically fix your depression what strategies work ?

Thanks. I had heard a theory that if you already have enough serotonin then neither 5-HTP nor l-tryptophan will help. In fact if they convert to serotonin then you may end up with too much and not be able to sleep, hence causing insomnia. I guess it works for some and not others.	thanks i had heard a theory that if you already have enough serotonin then neither htp nor l tryptophan will help in fact if they convert to serotonin then you may end up with too much and not be able to sleep hence causing insomnia i guess it works for some and not others 	0.225	0.0	54	1
I barely stop myself, but whenever something annoys me I think of the most hurtful comment that I could possibly say to them, and for that split second I feel that I am completely justified to say that. But even when someone is saying nothing I feel like they are silently judging me somehow. I know it's crazy but nothing helps me from thinking that the world is against me or something (not meant to sound as melodramatic but I can't think of a better way to explain)	i barely stop myself but whenever something annoys me i think of the most hurtful comment that i could possibly say to them and for that split second i feel that i am completely justified to say that but even when someone is saying nothing i feel like they are silently judging me somehow i know it s crazy but nothing helps me from thinking that the world is against me or something not meant to sound as melodramatic but i can t think of a better way to explain 	0.1389	0.528	90	1
Hi :) It is awful to feel 'not normal'. I don't ever remember feeling anything other than a freak for a long time. Self-harming was just one of many ways that I 'coped' with the storm inside my head. But I have spent 5 years learning ways of dealing in a healthy way. I never engage in harmful behaviour to cope with stress anymore...wow just saying that makes me feel somehow amazed at how different I was to back then; back when I drank, occasionally took drugs, binged and purged on food and self-harmed. I never once now have the urge to engage in any harmful behaviour (the worst I do now is eat a whole pizza to myself followed by a mountain of ice-cream - bit again that isn't to punish myself so it isn't the same thing). So why is I have not got any desire to 'give in' to addictions? Because I learned to love myself. I love myself too much to disrespect myself in such a way. I know I deserve to be happy. And that lesson is probably the most important of anyone's life. The tools that helped me vary from self-affirmations to meditation (no I'm not a crazy hippy, I promise ;)). People do care, but they don't know how to deal with uncomfortable things. There is too much stigma surrounding it. I am trying to raise awareness and now try to help people that go through similar things that I survived. That's how I see it. I survived. If you'd like to speak in more detail please feel free to ask :) xx	hi happy it is awful to feel not normal i don t ever remember feeling anything other than a freak for a long time self harming was just one of many ways that i coped with the storm inside my head but i have spent years learning ways of dealing in a healthy way i never engage in harmful behaviour to cope with stress anymore wow just saying that makes me feel somehow amazed at how different i was to back then back when i drank occasionally took drugs binged and purged on food and self harmed i never once now have the urge to engage in any harmful behaviour the worst i do now is eat a whole pizza to myself followed by a mountain of ice cream bit again that isn t to punish myself so it isn t the same thing so why is i have not got any desire to give in to addictions ? because i learned to love myself i love myself too much to disrespect myself in such a way i know i deserve to be happy and that lesson is probably the most important of anyone s life the tools that helped me vary from self to meditation no i m not a crazy hippy i promise ;)) people do care but they don t know how to deal with uncomfortable things there is too much stigma surrounding it i am trying to raise awareness and now try to help people that go through similar things that i survived that s how i see it i survived if you d like to speak in more detail please feel free to ask happy xx 	0.13	0.4625	281	1
"I tried for 2-weeks and then stopped as I decided to get tested for apnoea before trying SRT (yet) again. SRT can be brutal and I think a lot of people get anxious about it. A quote I liked from a book called 'The Effortless Sleep Method' is: ""If you are lucky enough to be referred to a sleep specialist, you may be unlucky enough to be advised to embark on a sleep restriction programme."" I don't think sleepio can hurt in the long run as long as you don't kick yourself if you don't succeed at it. I am not sure that therapists know how difficult SRT is or the anxiety it can cause some people who don't have the willpower to stick with the programme."	i tried for weeks and then stopped as i decided to get tested for apnoea before trying srt yet again srt can be brutal and i think a lot of people get anxious about it a quote i liked from a book called the effortless sleep method is if you are lucky enough to be referred to a sleep specialist you may be unlucky enough to be advised to embark on a sleep restriction programme i don t think can hurt in the long run as long as you don t kick yourself if you don t succeed at it i am not sure that therapists know how difficult srt is or the anxiety it can cause some people who don t have the willpower to stick with the programme 	-0.1042	0.5355	130	1

I do this to myself more than I'd like to admit. I'm a recovering drug addict, but I still have a few issues with alcohol. It runs in the family. So, sometimes when I'm feeling really low, I drink. The more I drink, the lower I get. The lower I get, the more I drink. See where I'm going with this. You're drunk, so yes, you are probably being a bit more honest than you're used to - but I'm sorry, you're also drunk. Drink some water, eat some plain bread to soak up the alcohol in your system, and sober up a little. I'm serious - because alcohol isn't a cure, all it really does (at least in my experience) is either cover up what you're suffering, or just magnify the pain. You are in no way, shape, or form wrong for feeling the way you do, but the alcohol doesn't help. Please, sober up, and if you're still feeling that suicidal to the point you want to take your life - all I ask is that you come back here and make your feelings and emotions known. That's what this sub is for, and there are people who are here because they want to help. Please, you're worth the fight, even if you don't feel like it right now. Even when you're sober and you don't feel like, you're worth the fight.	i do this to myself more than i d like to admit i m a recovering drug addict but i still have a few issues with alcohol it runs in the family so sometimes when i m feeling really low i drink the more i drink the lower i get the lower i get the more i drink see where i m going with this you re drunk so yes you are probably being a bit more honest than you re used to but i m sorry you re also drunk drink some water eat some plain bread to soak up the alcohol in your system and sober up a little i m serious because alcohol isn t a cure all it really does at least in my experience is either cover up what you re suffering or just the pain you are in no way shape or form wrong for feeling the way you do but the alcohol doesn t help please sober up and if you re still feeling that suicidal to the point you want to take your life all i ask is that you come back here and make your feelings and emotions known that s what this sub is for and there are people who are here because they want to help please you re worth the fight even if you don t feel like it right now even when you re sober and you don t feel like you re worth the fight 	0.0326	0.3876	249	1
I have auditory hallucinations and delusions of grandeur and paranoia. I basically have voices that are there talking major awful shit about every single thing I do. And during social interaction it distracts me throughout a conversation. But with my diagnosis, I can tell when the voices are not real, it's just really tiring though. The paranoia and grandeur is very tough socially speaking, it has ruined countless relationships so, I don't really bother with it anymore other than at work...And that's made things a little bit more stress free. I am not violent physically or emotionally towards others. I have a strong stance against abuse of all types... but, as far as what I told my Dr. and therapist, it took a very long time to realize this wasn't normal, as well as being able to admit it to another person. Then they prescribed me Zoloft and quetiapine	i have auditory hallucinations and delusions of grandeur and paranoia i basically have voices that are there talking major awful shit about every single thing i do and during social interaction it distracts me throughout a conversation but with my diagnosis i can tell when the voices are not real it s just really tiring though the paranoia and grandeur is very tough socially speaking it has ruined countless relationships so i don t really bother with it anymore other than at work and that s made things a little bit more stress free i am not violent physically or emotionally towards others i have a strong stance against abuse of all types but as far as what i told my dr and therapist it took a very long time to realize this wasn t normal as well as being able to admit it to another person then they prescribed me zoloft and 	0.0345	0.5437	153	1
If you didn't need them, your Dr would not be refilling your rx. So, unless you are buying them off some shady dude on a street corner, you are not doing anything wrong. I live with an 'invisible illness' just as you do. Admittedly, at the moment, mine is no where near as bad as yours, but I live with pain, and I know it will only get worse as I get older. People do not understand pain as an 'illness'. It is hard for people to see you walking around without any physical imparement, looking, as it were, 'normal'. They don't see that every step you take hurts, because you have gotten good at hiding the grimaces. You play down the pain bacause you don't want to be talking about it all the time. People don't understand the sleep deprivation from waking every hour from the pain because you have moved in your sleep into a painful position. I completely understand your not wanting to take the narcotics, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do to get through the day. When your chiro said you were flexible, did they check you for hypermobility? Hypermobility Syndrome is characterised by extremely lax ligaments, and could possibly go some way to explaining some of your pain (the ligaments don't hold your muscles and joints together properly causing joint and muscular pain). Just throwing that out there as something to look at! I found pilates and yoga quite good for teaching me breathing techniques to breathe through the pain, and also for strengthening my core muscles to provide better stability for my skeleton. Pain and depression are intrinsically linked. When I am having a bad time with my pain, the depression quickly follows. Sorry that there is no more that I can add. Just that I know how it can be with people judging you for taking so many drugs, without really even being in the situation to understand why.

"I had a panic attack in front of my boyfriend, and now I don't know how to face him. I usually never cry in front of other people, but these past few weeks I've had random crying phases that pop up several times a day, and they have been really confusing and frustrating. However, recently (and I think it's due to the meds I'm on) I had a really bad breakdown right in front of my boyfriend. I know I didn't make sense but I couldn't stop crying. At that moment in time I really wanted the whole world to just end. But what hurt me the most is that he started yelling at me too, and kept on saying ""I don't understand you"" and ""What do you want from me"" and ""I give up"". I was on the floor and he was all the way across the room. At that moment I wanted him to just be close to me and maybe let me know I wasn't completely alone. I realize now that this is just me wanting something and not considering what the other person is feeling, but now I don't know how to face him. One, because I am completely mortified by how much I cried and babbled. Two, because I can't help but feel hurt by how he got angry at me, even though on multiple occasions I have tried to tell him what is wrong with me, and what happens to me recently. He always avoids conversation about my depression, saying ""don't think about it, if you think about it, it won't go away"".

"My experience wasn't too bad. I was 17, the oldest there, and probably the most sane, so it was a little scary, being surrounded by people who had a hard time controlling themselves. I was only there for three days, and 3 of the kids there got ""bootyjuiced"", which is a sedative injected into your ass, and then tossed into a 10x10 room with nothing in it but a small square window in the door. I was miserable, however. My mom packed me a duffle bag with books and clothes, which I was able to keep, but all the drawstrings and shoe laces were confiscated. I had a room with 10 beds all to myself, and I was allowed to stay in my room as long as I liked. I saw the surveillance videos, and the bedrooms weren't being recorded. One of the nurses took pity on me and awarded me the ability to go off the ward, to the gym and the cafeteria and outside to go for walks. I was also allowed to use a razor to shave. I had pretty fresh self harm scars at that time so you can imagine my surprise. Technically you only get those privileges if you go to all the group sessions and participate in activities and ""school"", but I got lucky I guess. I complained so much to my assigned doctor that I wanted to leave, that he just let me go. The other 20 or so kids were held under very strict rules and watched like hawks.

I've spent so long trying to figure out what caused it, maybe I'm tired? Maybe it's PMT? Maybe it's my job maybe I hate it? Maybe it's my boyfriend? Maybe it's my friend group? So I've spent years 'hitting the refresh button' on my life, shaking things up and although some choices turned out to be good choices a lot of them were bad. Because I would do them but still feel awful or even worse. And I'd ask myself 'what's wrong with me why aren't I coping like other people, why am I not happy?' That's what made it all so much worse, then I'd repress emotions because I thought they weren't normal but they are. Being a part of this horrible yet supportive sub reddit should help you see that. Yes we don't work like others do, yes we deal with things differently, we aren't broken or strange. I had a kidney infection last year, I left it and it got worse and I couldn't drink for six months, that was strange and it meant i was different to other people, i couldn't get drunk and have fun like they did (like now i'm depressed, i don't feel the fun that they seem to be having), but i got help and i got better and it meant i could drink and i could have fun again. Our illness is just like that but it's not visible to others, we aren't showing physical pain, it just means that we're working differently to they are because we are ill, i used to spent weeks even months feeling suicidal, now i have minutes, hours at most, because i've sought help (like i did with my kidney) and i'm getting better, which means i'll be able to deal with things better, like others. We all work differently, every one of us, so we aren't broken just because we're working differently to others. People were there for me and looked after me when i was ill with my kidney because it was visible, i kept my depression from people and shut them out because i thought i was strange and broken, now i'm learning to let people in and feel the emotions and it's so much better, i talk to people and they understand better so they can help better in the future, instead of me just being angry or seeming moody, meaning they got fed up or angry they can now sympathise. Anyway the point to all of this was, sometimes there isn't a reason, maybe there used to be and maybe there is one big thing that's caused your depression and makes it worse, but like my kidney once it was bad it was bad, and when it got worse sometimes it meant it was just taking longer to get better, do you see that depression is like that? we left it a bit too late because we didn't understand what was wrong, so we got a little worse. Which meant we were already there, already ill. So now, when we have down days it doesn't mean that something has caused it, if you go on trying to find something, anything, when you don't feel better you will end up hating yourself, being angry at yourself. If you just let yourself feel everything you feel, no explanations as to why you're feeling it (unless you can pinpoint it for definite) then when you have those moments of clearness, clarity and those little moments of feeling happy, you'll be at a better place to try and work out if anything was wrong, because you'll see it clearer.

I do have regrets of having given up on so many things, I just don't even know how to stick with something at this point. Art is pretty much the only thing I ever keep in my life, but I frequently give up on those projects and such because of apathy.

I honestly can't point to a specific trigger for why I got depressed. I always had days where I was really sad/down my entire life. Those days somehow slowly turned into multiple consecutive days, then weeks, then a full on depression. I also had miserable coping skills with conflicts/problems which didn't really help. I worried about everything really, my lack of any successful relationship, being a virgin, fucking up my college degree, the people I had dissappointed, the oportunities I had missed, what I could have done different ... pointless worrying really about stuff I should have just accepted. I tried therapy twice, once during my 2nd hospital stay, which was helpful for getting a bit more insight into the underlying problems, and then again during the last year, which was absolutely pointless - a lot of talking about my problems and what I could do about them ... I found it rather useless, I always knew what to do and what my issues where, I just didn't manage to actually do what needed to be done. I told my parents pretty early, but avoided telling them about a lot of the gory details and how bad it really was. My parents were fantastic the whole time ... I told some close friends too, but only very superficial information.	i honestly can t point to a specific trigger for why i got depressed i always had days where i was really sad down my entire life those days somehow slowly turned into multiple consecutive days then weeks then a full on depression i also had miserable coping skills with conflicts problems which didn t really help i worried about everything really my lack of any successful relationship being a virgin fucking up my college degree the people i had dissappointed the i had missed what i could have done different pointless worrying really about stuff i should have just accepted i tried therapy twice once during my nd hospital stay which was helpful for getting a bit more insight into the underlying problems and then again during the last year which was absolutely pointless a lot of talking about my problems and what i could do about them i found it rather useless i always knew what to do and what my issues where i just didn t manage to actually do what needed to be done i told my parents pretty early but avoided telling them about a lot of the gory details and how bad it really was my parents were fantastic the whole time i told some close friends too but only very superficial information 	0.0083	0.5785	219	1

"Had a very bad break down in school today. Not even sure I can make it through the night. Long and heart wrenching story short, my bestfriend, who was my boyfriend for a very long time up until he tried to kill himself a month ago and came back saying he wanted a break because he might be gay. Well, today, walking to lunch, I saw him holding this girl M's hand... I don't know what came over me, but I screamed ""I can't! No!"" and ran into the bathroom, where coincidentally my best friend Chloe had been. I started screaming and crying and, apparently, I said ""I just want to die"" a few times. M, who has actually been making mine and his life a living hell for months, came in and started yelling at me, saying ""What the fuck is wrong? Is it because w were holding hands? He's gay, get over it!"" and I just died inside at that point, because, if he really is gay, I'm losing everything I had at one point, indefinitely. I guess I kept asking her to stop but she wouldn't so Chloe made her leave, and while Chloe was gone, I threw up all over myself while I cried. A counselor came in and took me to the office where my favorite teacher (guy. funny. suffers from anxiety and depression) let me just vent, since he knows everything I have gone through with bestfriend/boyfriend person. I had to write an incident report because of what Madison did and shit. I got calmed down and when I finally started walking back to class, I saw M with bestfriend/boyfriend's beanie... I died a little and went to class with tears in my eyes, as always. After that class ended, I went to bestfriend/boyfriend- let's start calling him J- and said ""I don't think you mean to, but you're breaking my heart."" and he just looked at me and said he was sorry, and explained him and M have *nothing* going on at all, and he just held her hand for a moment to calm her down. I explained how awful it is, since I used to mean everything to him and now I feel like I mean nothing at all to him. He said, and I quote ""I never meant to push anyone out, especially not *you*. You still mean a lot to me. Like, a lot, I just..."" I then said ""Do we have a chance anymore, J?"" to which he responded to by shrugging and saying ""I don't know."" and then he gave me a hug and I whispered ""I'm sorry"" into his neck and he just gave me the saddest look I've ever seen and went into art textiles... I know he really doesn't know. He's not saying it because he doesn't have the guts to say no. He's just extremely fucking confused with everything at the moment. This is the first time since he got back that I've actually expressed that this is effecting me negatively, and I didn't even *really* express it to him. Two of our friends are going to talk to him about this tomorrow, because they are both quite pissed about the way he's handling this, especially after today... I miss what I had, and I don't know why I feel so broken. I really just want to die, to be honest. It would feel a lot better than this... I'm cutting again, I've stopped taking my meds... I just... I've been suffering in silence for a month. Today, I broke that silence, but in the wrong way, and to the wrong person... Sorry for that wall of text."	had a very bad break down in school today not even sure i can make it through the night long and heart wrenching story short my bestfriend who was my boyfriend for a very long time up until he tried to kill himself a month ago and came back saying he wanted a break because he might be gay well today walking to lunch i saw him holding this girl m s hand i don t know what came over me but i screamed i can t ! no ! and ran into the bathroom where coincidentally my best friend chloe had been i started screaming and crying and apparently i said i just want to die a few times m who has actually been making mine and his life a living hell for months came in and started yelling at me saying what the fuck is wrong ? is it because w were holding hands ? he s gay get over it ! and i just died inside at that point because if he really is gay i m losing everything i had at one point indefinitely i guess i kept asking her to stop but she wouldn t so chloe made her leave and while chloe was gone i threw up all over myself while i cried a counselor came in and took me to the office where my favorite teacher guy funny suffers from anxiety and depression let me just vent since he knows everything i have gone through with bestfriend boyfriend person i had to write an incident report because of what madison did and shit i got calmed down and when i finally started walking back to class i saw m with bestfriend boyfriend s beanie i died a little and went to class with tears in my eyes as always after that class ended i went to bestfriend boyfriend let s start calling him j and said i don t think you mean to but you re breaking my heart and he just looked at me and said he was sorry and explained him and m have *nothing* going on at all and he just held her hand for a moment to calm her down i explained how awful it is since i used to mean everything to him and now i feel like i mean nothing at all to him he said and i quote i never meant to push anyone out especially not *you* you still mean a lot to me like a lot i just i then said do we have a chance anymore j ? to which he responded to by shrugging and saying i don t know and then he gave me a hug and i whispered i m sorry into his neck and he just gave me the saddest look i ve ever seen and went into art textiles i know he really doesn t know he s not saying it because he doesn t have the guts to say no he s just extremely fucking confused with everything at the moment this is the first time since he got back that i ve actually expressed that this is effecting me negatively and i didn t even *really* express it to him two of our friends are going to talk to him about this tomorrow because they are both quite pissed about the way he s handling this especially after today i miss what i had and i don t know why i feel so broken i really just want to die to be honest it would feel a lot better than this i m cutting again i ve stopped taking my meds i just i ve been suffering in silence for a month today i broke that silence but in the wrong way and to the wrong person sorry for that wall of text 	-0.0802	0.5325	647	1

I do find sometimes I feel numb, but it doesn't make you happy. It just balances out your moods!

M/25 for email penpals! Hullo all! Always enjoyed making new friends and chatting to new people, so reaching out! Basic stats; I'm 25, English, white and non-religious! Graduated from university with a 2:1 degree in Forensic Science last July. A little extra; I'm an avid writer, and I've had two published short stories with a third coming out sometime this year. I'm aspiring to get a novel (or many) published. I love swimming, travel, animals, science (especially space and everything related), food, music, movies and books! Even more; I'm a self confessed geek, with major interests in Lord of the Rings, Pokemon, Game of Thrones and several other niche markets (including Games Workshop's book publishing company, The Black Library). And finally; I'm currently in the third year of a serious, committed relationship, and we are presently travelling around Australia together (arrived here in Oz in November). Note; I'm only putting myself up for email penpals, as snail mail is too costly on a backpackers budget! Hit me up with a PM!	m for email penpals ! all ! always enjoyed making new friends and chatting to new people so reaching out ! basic stats i m english white and non religious ! graduated from university with a degree in forensic science last july a little extra i m an avid writer and i ve had two published short stories with a third coming out sometime this year i m aspiring to get a novel or many published i love swimming travel animals science especially space and everything related food music movies and books ! even more i m a self confessed geek with major interests in lord of the rings pokemon game of thrones and several other niche markets including games workshop s book publishing company the black library and finally i m currently in the third year of a serious committed relationship and we are presently travelling around australia together arrived here in oz in november note i m only putting myself up for email penpals as snail mail is too costly on a backpackers budget ! hit me up with a pm ! 	0.0521	0.1485	184	0

Initially, the hour glass shape was the mob farm, but it didn't work because it was too low (monsters would spawn in the caves below, not in the farm) so I made another mob farm on top of it, the upper most part is the chamber where they spawn, with 4 8-long and 2-wide canals that lead to the hole in the middle. And yes, sorry, everything was done with vanilla minecraft. EDIT: Monsters spawn within a range of 144x144 according to the video I watched, but they only move when you're in range (about 32 blocks). Yet if you are to close, they don't spawn, I think they spawn when you're 24 blocks away. So I made sure that the floor of the dark room on top was 30 blocks above the floor where you can kill the mobs. Because it is so high up (the collecting floor is 72+ above the ground, to prevent monsters from spawning below) and I put torches on the ceiling and the collecting floor, they are forced to spawn in the room. In the room, there are 4 canals leading to the hole in the middle, which are 2 blocks deep, in order to prevent the mobs to escape. At the bottom of the tunnel, i put slabs in order to kill the monster and prevent spiders from escaping. This is the video which helped me a lot: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liYHNsXTcBc	initially the hour glass shape was the mob farm but it didn t work because it was too low monsters would spawn in the caves below not in the farm so i made another mob farm on top of it the upper most part is the chamber where they spawn with long and wide canals that lead to the hole in the middle and yes sorry everything was done with vanilla minecraft edit monsters spawn within a range of according to the video i watched but they only move when you re in range about blocks yet if you are to close they don t spawn i think they spawn when you re blocks away so i made sure that the floor of the dark room on top was blocks above the floor where you can kill the mobs because it is so high up the collecting floor is above the ground to prevent monsters from spawning below and i put torches on the ceiling and the collecting floor they are forced to spawn in the room in the room there are canals leading to the hole in the middle which are blocks deep in order to prevent the mobs to escape at the bottom of the tunnel i put slabs in order to kill the monster and prevent spiders from escaping this is the video which helped me a lot 	0.0712	0.5905	231	0

Yes, a perpetual expansion into space seems to be the only alternative to entropic collapse, whether for human or robot. It is of interest that Ray Kurzweil believes that we must be the only (or at least, the most advanced) intelligence in this galaxy. He reasons that if an equivalent intelligence arose anywhere else in the past few million years, it would have evolved its own Singularity, and this technology would have already filled the galaxy. He does not consider the opposing possibility -- that the appearance of a Singularity always destroys its host, and for this reason, we seem to be alone.	yes a perpetual expansion into space seems to be the only alternative to collapse whether for human or robot it is of interest that ray kurzweil believes that we must be the only or at least the most advanced intelligence in this galaxy he reasons that if an equivalent intelligence arose anywhere else in the past few million years it would have evolved its own singularity and this technology would have already filled the galaxy he does not consider the opposing possibility that the appearance of a singularity always destroys its host and for this reason we seem to be alone 	0.115	0.5345	101	0

The first couple times I smoked nothing happened; it became frustrating for me. I wanted to know what being high was like. I then started to get high and understood what it was like. Just be careful when you first start out. You may see that people smoke more than you. Don't worry, that's okay; it isn't a contest. Being *too* high is a thing and it isn't good if you're first starting out. I also suggest doing it somewhere safe around good company (or alone. There's nothing wrong with smoking alone). Just enjoy yourself.

If comteks are way out of your range, I've used a Sennheiser G3 connected to a headphone preamp in video village. Worked great for a few gigs, but it means the headphones are tethered to video village. This happened to work well at the time because it cost me $20 to rent a G3 and the clients and scripty where also at video village. Here's the headphone preamp I used.

"So I was trainig one day and I was doing incline bicep curls and was just finishing my third set with a pair of 14kg dumbbells. So this guy next to me is doing preacher dumbbell curls with a 16kg dumbbell. And since I can't find the other 16kg dumbbells (not a huge gym) I am waiting for him to finish. And once he is done I ask him: ""Hey, are you gonna use that dumbbell again soon?"" So he answers: ""No, that was my last set."" At this point I just grab the 16kg dumbbells and all of a sudden he asks me: ""Hey, just a quick Q - are you using ""the chemistry""?"" And I was like: ""Yeah, sure. Protein powder, creatine, you know."" (Because hey, creatine is made in a lab, so in my understanding it's chemistry.) And he was like: ""No, no, no I mean ""THE chemistry"", as in steroids."" And I'm like: *laugh* ""No man, I'm clean"" And just as I say that, I hear him say back in a turned on gay way: ""Hmm, well you've done a lot of work and made 'em big"" And trust me, I was amazed by the compliment and that gave me sooo much motivation. Even though a gay dude said it. I knew he was gay btw, but that sentence just made me giggle on the inside. And it's not that I don't like gays, they're fine - a compliment is a compliment from whoever you receive it."	so i was one day and i was doing incline bicep curls and was just finishing my third set with a pair of kg dumbbells so this guy next to me is doing preacher dumbbell curls with a kg dumbbell and since i can t find the other kg dumbbells not a huge gym i am waiting for him to finish and once he is done i ask him hey are you gonna use that dumbbell again soon ? so he answers no that was my last set at this point i just grab the kg dumbbells and all of a sudden he asks me hey just a quick q are you using the chemistry ? and i was like yeah sure protein powder creatine you know because hey creatine is made in a lab so in my understanding it s chemistry and he was like no no no i mean the chemistry as in steroids and i m like no man i m clean and just as i say that i hear him say back in a turned on gay way hmm well you ve done a lot of work and made em big and trust me i was amazed by the compliment and that gave me so much motivation even though a gay dude said it i knew he was gay btw but that sentence just made me giggle on the inside and it s not that i don t like gays they re fine a compliment is a compliment from whoever you receive it 	0.1777	0.234	257	0

"Didn't know the term (but the thing). From the Wikipedia article: Not invented here (NIH) is the philosophical principle of not using third party solutions to a problem because of their external origins. False pride often drives an enterprise to use less-than-perfect invention in order to save face by ignoring, boycotting, or otherwise refusing to use or incorporate obviously superior solutions by others. Though ""reinventing the wheel"" isn't necessarily a pride problem or somesuch. E.g. I always see people in /r/javahelp and /r/learnjava using Scanner(System.in) and struggling with the intricacies of using methods other than just .nextLine(). I never use those methods, so I don't have to ponder all that for a second. I just use .nextLine() and do any required parsing/checking in utility methods that I made over time. Another example are cases where you just prefer to do things a certain way, but the available libraries do it differently, so either you adapt (which might not always be easily possible), or you make your own. Also, there might be solutions that you just don't happen to hear about."	didn t know the term but the thing from the wikipedia article not invented here nih is the philosophical principle of not using third party solutions to a problem because of their external origins false pride often drives an enterprise to use less than perfect invention in order to save face by ignoring boycotting or otherwise refusing to use or incorporate obviously superior solutions by others though reinventing the wheel isn t necessarily a pride problem or somesuch e g i always see people in r and r using scanner system in and struggling with the intricacies of using methods other than just i never use those methods so i don t have to ponder all that for a second i just use and do any required parsing checking in utility methods that i made over time another example are cases where you just prefer to do things a certain way but the available libraries do it differently so either you adapt which might not always be easily possible or you make your own also there might be solutions that you just don t happen to hear about 	0.1069	0.438	188	0
If you read into the comments of the article, most of them involve bashing liberals who hate on Harper. Put the party ties away and face it, under Harper's leadership, there's been scandals, questionable changes to the cabinet, massive environmental cuts, continuous funding on a proven ineffective war on drugs. I'm not saying I support other political candidates for office, but we need new leadership, as well as that dusty box of cobwebs we a senate removed. On a personal note circling back to environmental cuts, my father finished his third diploma in environmental engineering 2 years ago, and in his final year nearly every government position he could have applied for was terminated. He wanted to repair some damage done to this country, but now he's stuck working 90 hour weeks testing asphalt quality in the middle of nowhere.	if you read into the comments of the article most of them involve bashing liberals who hate on harper put the party ties away and face it under harper s leadership there s been scandals questionable changes to the cabinet massive environmental cuts continuous funding on a proven ineffective war on drugs i m not saying i support other political candidates for office but we need new leadership as well as that dusty box of cobwebs we a senate removed on a personal note circling back to environmental cuts my father finished his third diploma in environmental engineering years ago and in his final year nearly every government position he could have applied for was terminated he wanted to repair some damage done to this country but now he s stuck working hour weeks testing asphalt quality in the middle of nowhere 	-0.0778	0.617	142	0
