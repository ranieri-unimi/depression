I would update/re-install your**[ drivers](http://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/75991/en-us)** if you haven't yet. If that doesn't help it could be a hardware issue. If its hardware, it could be your card overheating or just going bad ,your power supply overheating or going bad, or even possibly RAM. First, I would heavily dust out your case, especially around the PSU, card heatsink, and CPU heatsink. You can download a monitoring program (I like **[Speccy](https://www.piriform.com/speccy/download/standard)**, but there are several) and a stress test (I like **[FurMark](http://www.ozone3d.net/benchmarks/fur/)**, but again, any is good.) and see how hot everything gets; your card is listed as 105c max operating temp, but ideally they would be around 95ish while stressing. You could also attempt to re-apply the thermal paste if it does seem that heat is an issue. To test RAM, **[Memtest86](http://www.memtest86.com/download.htm)** works fairly well. I would start it before bed and see how its doing in the morning as it can take a while or run indefinitely. Your PSU can be tricky to test unless you have a multimeter or ideally a power supply tester. If your video card isnt receiving enough power when it needs it, bad stuff happens. Let us know if that helps of not!	i would update re install your *[ drivers if you haven t yet if that doesn t help it could be a hardware issue if its hardware it could be your card overheating or just going bad your power supply overheating or going bad or even possibly ram first i would heavily dust out your case especially around the psu card heatsink and cpu heatsink you can download a monitoring program i like *[ speccy but there are several and a stress test i like *[ but again any is good and see how hot everything gets your card is listed as c max operating temp but ideally they would be around ish while stressing you could also attempt to re apply the thermal paste if it does seem that heat is an issue to test ram *[ works fairly well i would start it before bed and see how its doing in the morning as it can take a while or run indefinitely your psu can be tricky to test unless you have a multimeter or ideally a power supply tester if your video card isnt receiving enough power when it needs it bad stuff happens let us know if that helps of not ! 	0.0875	0.3735	206	0

Wow, how relevant! I was actually going through this subreddit in hopes of forgetting about this random sadness I'm experiencing now. Like you, it happens all the time, and it is mostly disappointment towards myself. Though lately I have been pinpointing small triggers. For instance, I am taking care of a one-year-old baby, and every time he gets a little upset because of me (he's a huge mama's boy so if I'm trying to hold him while mama is around, he'll get upset), I get a sad, then I start thinking too much ... It looks terrible, especially since I tend to just lay down on my stomach (or sit up if that's not an option) and look into the distance when I'm sad.	wow how relevant ! i was actually going through this subreddit in hopes of forgetting about this random sadness i m experiencing now like you it happens all the time and it is mostly disappointment towards myself though lately i have been pinpointing small triggers for instance i am taking care of a one year old baby and every time he gets a little upset because of me he s a huge mama s boy so if i m trying to hold him while mama is around he ll get upset i get a sad then i start thinking too much it looks terrible especially since i tend to just lay down on my stomach or sit up if that s not an option and look into the distance when i m sad 	-0.1862	0.6411	133	1

"The earliest advent of progressive forms in English came from Latin translations. In languages without a lot progressive forms, like Spanish and French, a simple verb-phrase like ""I eat"" could mean several different things: I eat now, I eat regularly, I eat today, etc. Latin has different verb forms for all those statements, and languages without that verb structure had to append adjectives to describe the same idea. (Spanish ""I eat"" is ""Yo como"", I eat now is ""Hoy como"" or ""Yo como ahora"", etc) So in translating the Latin, English took the route of appending verbs to a progressive form, to easily translate the Latin ideas. [Here's a quite wordy article about some of this](http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~cpercy/courses/6362-lamont) As for the increasing usage of progressive forms, I think they gain popularity becuase they are brief compared to fully explaining your meaning, and English, specifically American English, is lazy."	the earliest advent of progressive forms in english came from latin translations in languages without a lot progressive forms like spanish and french a simple verb phrase like i eat could mean several different things i eat now i eat regularly i eat today etc latin has different verb forms for all those statements and languages without that verb structure had to append adjectives to describe the same idea spanish i eat is yo como i eat now is hoy como or yo como ahora etc so in translating the latin english took the route of verbs to a progressive form to easily translate the latin ideas here s a quite wordy article about some of this as for the increasing usage of progressive forms i think they gain popularity becuase they are brief compared to fully explaining your meaning and english specifically american english is lazy 	-0.0072	0.0	147	0

Are there any exercises that you can't do with a EZ curl barbell that you normally can with a regular/straight barbell? 3. Whenever I use the inner thigh machine at the gym (squeezing thighs closed with about 40 lbs of weight) I get a very weird painful sensation in my groin, is that normal? I'm a girl if that helps.	i m a total newb to fitness so i have stupid questions any tips for doing a proper deadlift ? i feel like i m getting pains in my back for a reason are there any exercises that you can t do with a ez curl barbell that you normally can with a regular straight barbell ? whenever i use the inner thigh machine at the gym squeezing thighs closed with about lbs of weight i get a very weird painful sensation in my groin is that normal ? i m a girl if that helps 	-0.195	0.4455	96	1
Ugh. I had a miscarriage at 7 weeks. I'm 23 and not ready anyway, not that it isn't shitty. But in the couple days I was passing the tissue it felt so gross. The larger pieces would hurt coming through my cervix and as soon as it stopped hurting I could feel it in my vagina. I would sit on the toilet and feeling it fall out of me was really unpleasant. I'm glad it happened early on at least. The biggest pieces were about the size of a mouse but there were only a few. I'm sorry you went through that, especially being further along. That really must have been an awful reminder a half a year later.	ugh i had a miscarriage at weeks i m and not ready anyway not that it isn t shitty but in the couple days i was passing the tissue it felt so gross the larger pieces would hurt coming through my cervix and as soon as it stopped hurting i could feel it in my vagina i would sit on the toilet and feeling it fall out of me was really unpleasant i m glad it happened early on at least the biggest pieces were about the size of a mouse but there were only a few i m sorry you went through that especially being further along that really must have been an awful reminder a half a year later 	-0.1265	0.5693	121	1

Talking off topic is out of control in my DD group. I'm guilty of it too, unfortunately. I'm not the worst offender, but I'm certainly one of them. Talking off topic and getting sidetracked is a huge problem in my group, though. I swear, we could get more done in a game, or finish a game faster, if everyone could concentrate. The DM made a rule that conversation can only have one degree of separation (and presumably has to be kept as short as possible), but it didn't seem to help much. We also tried writing thoughts down on a note card and talking about them later, but that didn't do much good either. I can tell that the quieter members of the group that want to concentrate on the game are getting annoyed. Hell, I'm getting annoyed and I'm one of the worst offenders. I want to concentrate on the game. I do! But there are three very talkative girls in our group (myself included) and everything reminds us of some dumb story that we absolutely have to share or something. Anyway, I'm looking for advice. I'm not the DM, but we've talked about how to control it in the past. I would like some tips on what we can do to keep the chatter down. We don't get to play often (we played tonight, and the previous game was 4/22) because of conflicting schedules, and we can usually only play for a few hours at a time, so making the most of that time would be awesome, instead of spending 25% of it talking about nothing.	talking off topic is out of control in my dd group i m guilty of it too unfortunately i m not the worst offender but i m certainly one of them talking off topic and getting sidetracked is a huge problem in my group though i swear we could get more done in a game or finish a game faster if everyone could concentrate the dm made a rule that conversation can only have one degree of separation and presumably has to be kept as short as possible but it didn t seem to help much we also tried writing thoughts down on a note card and talking about them later but that didn t do much good either i can tell that the quieter members of the group that want to concentrate on the game are getting annoyed hell i m getting annoyed and i m one of the worst offenders i want to concentrate on the game i do ! but there are three very talkative girls in our group myself included and everything reminds us of some dumb story that we absolutely have to share or something anyway i m looking for advice i m not the dm but we ve talked about how to control it in the past i would like some tips on what we can do to keep the chatter down we don t get to play often we played tonight and the previous game was because of conflicting schedules and we can usually only play for a few hours at a time so making the most of that time would be awesome instead of spending of it talking about nothing 	-0.0819	0.5186	278	1

Crazy thought-- allow wrestlers (in kayfabe) to trade championships/title shots/etc. with one another For example, in 2010, Shawn Michaels was desperate to face Undertaker at WrestleMania, and knew that he had to win the Royal Rumble to do so, since Undertaker simply refused to grant him a rematch. Edge, not Michaels, won the 2010 Royal Rumble, and HBK's hopes pretty much completely went up in smoke. But what if Shawn Michaels had entered and won the Raw Elimination Chamber match for the WWE Championship, and then offered a trade with Edge-- your Royal Rumble number-one contendership for my WWE Championship. Who wouldn't take that deal if you're either side? Edge gets to be champion without having to fight for it, and Michaels gets the Royal Rumble contract (I guess it's a contract?), which he uses to grant himself a match against The Undertaker (who was the World Heavyweight Champion) at WrestleMania. Crazy enough to work?	crazy thought allow wrestlers in kayfabe to trade championships title shots etc with one another for example in shawn michaels was desperate to face undertaker at wrestlemania and knew that he had to win the royal rumble to do so since undertaker simply refused to grant him a rematch edge not michaels won the royal rumble and hbk s hopes pretty much completely went up in smoke but what if shawn michaels had entered and won the raw elimination chamber match for the wwe championship and then offered a trade with edge your royal rumble number one for my wwe championship who wouldn t take that deal if you re either side ? edge gets to be champion without having to fight for it and michaels gets the royal rumble contract i guess it s a contract ? which he uses to grant himself a match against the undertaker who was the world heavyweight champion at wrestlemania crazy enough to work ? 	-0.0979	0.4653	162	1

"How do you react to drunk people on the street at night? I've moved to a city with a very lively night life, and because of this I have to deal with a lot of drunk people walking around at night. I'm a 21m and on any given night I might have to walk past scores of drunk people to go to and from pubs or friends places or walk home from work. A lot of drunk guys my age show off by screaming at and trying to belittle any other guy who's walking by them. I'm in shape, and dress well, I usually look put together, and I'm beginning to feel like that's a factor in how aggressive other guys are when I'm walking alone at night. For example I was walking home tonight and a couple guys just start harassing me for drinking a bottle of water as I walk by, I literally got a ""You like that bottle of water faggot?"" shouted at me. I had a few comments I could have thrown back, but nothing I felt would be really affective. Is there a way of dealing with them without starting a fight?

NSV: I finally resisted my favorite food!! Its day two on Keto. My husband and I are traveling a bit today, so the only decent road lunch option was McDonald's. I got a bacon cheeseburger wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun (no side), and my husband got a large fry with his meal. The thing is, potatoes are my *obsession.* Fries, tots, hashbrowns, baked, scalloped...you name, I would destroy it.

I used to shave, not really often but I hated it. I prefer to use trimmers to keep it manageable and easier to clean my vulva. But otherwise I don't worry about pubic hair. Anyone who claims hairy genitals are disgusting is just being immature. Pubic hair is healthy - it's there for a fucking reason. There is nothing wrong with it. (Not to say that people who do shave/wax/etc. should be ashamed of doing so, it's your choice so do whatever makes you feel good.) My routine now is give it a trim about every 3 weeks or so. That way it's not too out of control, but I also don't have to worry about razor burn, cuts, etc. and it's not at all painful.	i used to shave not really often but i hated it i prefer to use trimmers to keep it manageable and easier to clean my vulva but otherwise i don t worry about pubic hair anyone who claims hairy genitals are disgusting is just being immature pubic hair is healthy it s there for a fucking reason there is nothing wrong with it not to say that people who do shave wax etc should be ashamed of doing so it s your choice so do whatever makes you feel good my routine now is give it a trim about every weeks or so that way it s not too out of control but i also don t have to worry about razor burn cuts etc and it s not at all painful 	-0.2481	0.6877	132	1

(Res. 122; A-08) http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/PolicyFinder/policyfiles/HnE/H-185.950.HTM **American Psychiatric Association** Position Statement on Access to Care for Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals (2012) The American Psychiatric Association: 1. Recognizes that appropriately evaluated transgender and gender variant individuals can benefit greatly from medical and surgical gender transition treatments. 2. Advocates for removal of barriers to care and supports both public and private health insurance coverage for gender transition treatment. 3. Opposes categorical exclusions of coverage for such medically necessary treatment when prescribed by a physician. www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Advocacy%20and%20Newsroom/Position%20Statements/ps2012_TransgenderCare.pdf Position Statement on Discrimination Against Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals (2012) Being transgender gender or variant implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities; however, these individuals often experience discrimination due to a lack of civil rights protections for their gender identity or expression Thus, this position statement is relevant to the APA because discrimination and lack of equal civil rights is damaging to the mental health of transgender and gender variant individuals. **The American Psychiatric Association:** 1. Supports laws that protect the civil rights of transgender and gender variant individuals. 2. Urges the repeal of laws and policies that discriminate against transgender and gender variant individuals. 3. Opposes all public and private discrimination against transgender and gender variant individuals in such areas as health care, employment, housing, public accommodation, education, and licensing. 4. Declares that no burden of proof of such judgment, capacity, or reliability shall be placed upon these individuals greater than that imposed on any other persons. www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Advocacy%20and%20Newsroom/Position%20Statements/ps2012_TransgenderDiscrimination.pdf American Psychological Association Policy on Transgender, Gender Identity Gender Expression Non-Discrimination (2008) As stated in the Policy on Transgender, Gender Identity Gender Expression NonDiscrimination, the APA opposes all public and private discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived gender identity and expression and urges the repeal of discriminatory laws and policies and calls upon psychologists in their professional roles to provide appropriate, nondiscriminatory treatment to transgender and gender variant individuals and encourages psychologists to take a leadership role in working against discrimination towards transgender and gender variant individuals. The APA recognizes the efficacy, benefit and medical necessity of gender transition treatments for appropriately evaluated individuals and calls upon public and private insurers to cover these medically necessary treatments. http://www.apa.org/about/policy/transgender.aspx **American Academy of Family Physicians** Resolution No. 1004 (2012) In 2007, an AAFP Commission declared that the association has a policy opposing any form of patient discrimination and stated its opposition to the exclusion of transgender health care. In 2012, the organization released a new resolution: RESOLVED, That the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) support efforts to require insurers to provide coverage for comprehensive care of [transgender] individuals including medical care, screening tests based on medical need rather than gender, mental health care, and, when medically necessary, gender reassignment surgery. http://www.aafp.org/dam/AAFP/documents/about_us/special_constituencies/2012RCAR_Advocacy.pdf **American Academy of Physician Assistants** Non-Discrimination Statement (Adopted 2000; amended 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008) Physician assistants should not discriminate against classes or categories of patients in the delivery of needed health care. Such classes and categories includegender identity. **American College of Nurse Midwives** Transgender/Transsexual/Gender Variant Health Care (2012) The American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM) supports efforts to provide transgender, transsexual, and gender variant individuals with access to safe, comprehensive, culturally competent health care and therefore endorses the 2011 World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care Please see Ethical Conduct for the Physician Assistant Profession (Adopted 2000, amended 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2008) and Comprehensive Health Care Reform (Adopted 2005 and amended 2010). **National Association of Social Workers** Transgender and Gender Identity Issues Policy Statement (2008) NASW supports the rights of all individuals to receive health insurance and other health coverage without discrimination on the basis of gender identity, and specifically without exclusion of services related to transgender or transsexual transitionin order to receive medical and mental health services through their primary care physician and the appropriate referrals to medical specialists, which may include hormone replacement therapy, surgical interventions, prosthetic devices, and other medical procedures. http://www.socialworkers.org/da/da2008/finalvoting/documents/Transgender%202nd%20round%20-%20Clean.pdf **World Professional Association for Transgender Health** Clarification on Medical Necessity of Treatment, Sex Reassignment, and Insurance Coverage in the U.S.A. (2008) WPATH found that decades of experience with the Standards of Care show gender transitions and related care to be accepted, good medical practice and effective treatment. In a 2008 clarification, WPATH stated: [S]ex reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria. Sex reassignment plays an undisputed role in contributing toward favorable outcomes, and comprises Real Life Experience, legal name and sex change on identity documents, as well as medically necessary hormone treatment, counseling, psychotherapy, and other medical procedures... The medical procedures attendant to sex reassignment are not cosmetic or elective or for the mere convenience of the patient. These reconstructive procedures are not optional in any meaningful sense, but are understood to be medically necessary for the treatment of the diagnosed condition. http://www.wpath.org/documents/Med%20Nec%20on%202008%20Letterhead.pdf **National Commission on Correctional Health Care** Position Statement: Transgender Health Care in Correctional Settings (2009) The health risks of overlooking the particular needs of transgender inmates are so severe that acknowledgment of the problem and policies that assure appropriate and responsible provision of health care are needed. Because prisons, jails, and juvenile justice facilities have a responsibility to ensure the physical and mental health and well-being of transgender people in their custody, correctional health staff should manage these inmates in a manner that respects the biomedical and psychological aspects of a gender identity disorder (GID) diagnosis. http://www.ncchc.org/transgender-health-care-in-correctional-settings	medical science would beg to disagree with you american medical association resolution removing financial barriers to care for transgender patients an established body of medical research demonstrates the effectiveness and medical necessity of mental health care hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery as forms of therapeutic treatment for many people diagnosed with gid therefore be it resolved that the ama supports public and private health insurance coverage for treatment of gender identity disorder resolution h removing financial barriers to care for transgender patients our ama supports public and private health insurance coverage for treatment of gender identity disorder as recommended by the patients physician res a american psychiatric association position statement on access to care for transgender and gender variant individuals the american psychiatric association recognizes that appropriately evaluated transgender and gender variant individuals can benefit greatly from medical and surgical gender transition treatments advocates for removal of barriers to care and supports both public and private health insurance coverage for gender transition treatment opposes categorical exclusions of coverage for such medically necessary treatment when prescribed by a physician position statement on discrimination against transgender and gender variant individuals being transgender gender or variant implies no impairment in judgment stability reliability or general social or vocational capabilities however these individuals often experience discrimination due to a lack of civil rights protections for their gender identity or expression thus this position statement is relevant to the apa because discrimination and lack of equal civil rights is damaging to the mental health of transgender and gender variant individuals the american psychiatric association supports laws that protect the civil rights of transgender and gender variant individuals urges the repeal of laws and policies that discriminate against transgender and gender variant individuals opposes all public and private discrimination against transgender and gender variant individuals in such areas as health care employment housing public accommodation education and licensing declares that no

Haven't had a checkup in a little over a decade, going in for one in about a month Hey everyone, as mentioned, my last checkup was about 13 years ago before I started college. My wife and I are discussing having a kid, and as a pre-step I wanted both of us to go in for a checkup to make sure there's nothing negative we need to be aware of. The problem is, in the years since my last checkup my old PCP has retired and his office closed. I know when you move to a new PCP you usually have your medical records transferred over, but in this case I have no idea who owns my medical records now to have them get transferred over. What should I do? If I go to the new doctor, can they just start new medical records for me?	haven t had a checkup in a little over a decade going in for one in about a month hey everyone as mentioned my last checkup was about years ago before i started college my wife and i are discussing having a kid and as a pre step i wanted both of us to go in for a checkup to make sure there s nothing negative we need to be aware of the problem is in the years since my last checkup my old pcp has retired and his office closed i know when you move to a new pcp you usually have your medical records transferred over but in this case i have no idea who owns my medical records now to have them get transferred over what should i do ? if i go to the new doctor can they just start new medical records for me ? 	0.0281	0.3887	150	0

"The Creatine Monster On a cold Friday afternoon, I had come home from school. I had been thinking of the gym all day. I was hungry, didn't have any lunch. In fact, I didn't eat because I spent the money. For the past month I was saving up for something. Something special which I bought at GNC. I was surprised they didn't ask for ID; I was pretty sure the cashier noticed how nervous I was. Anyways, my mom asked my how my day was when I got home, but I ignored her. I have more important things to do. I run to the bathroom and unpack my bag. In my school bag is a white plastic bag from GNC. I open the bag, first removing the receipt and flushing it down the toilet to get rid of the evidence. My heart was racing now. I unpack the creatine monster from the bag. I wonder what people will be asking me when they see that I will be 50lbs heavier. Should I say I was just eating a lot? I remove the label from the tub and tear it into a thousand small pieces. I flush that down the toilet, too. It is time now. I run up to my room when my mom ask me what I am holding. I panic, sweat drips down my forehead and my teeth chatter. ""Mom, it's just for a school project"". ""What project?"" ""I don't know mom I just started it!"". A tear runs down my cheek. I run upstairs and open the creatine, scooping upservings into a clear water bottle. What have I gotten myself into? I fill it with water and drink it. There is no turning back now. The creatine monster is inside me now, it will control me. What should I do if I die? I cant let my family know about this. I open the creatine tub and throw it all out the window; a white cloud of mysterious dust sparkles into the wind so graciously. I feel the substance taking control of me; I am now the monster. I walk downstairs, its time to work out; time to get big. Now I worry, I don't want to get too big; people will think I use steroids. I do use steroids. No I don't. Creatine. All I see is the weights now, I am almost downstairs when I hear ""Do you want a cookie I just baked?"" I know I do not have time for this shit now. ""No mom I do not want a fucking cookie."" I walk in the basement and drop to my knees before the weights, tears running down my cheeks. I turn to the right and look at myself in the mirror.

"Its really a shining monument of RTS history IMO. Absolutely. Indeed a shining monument to computer gaming of any sort. Like some older music there are a few bands, a few songs that stand the test of time and are as good now as the day they were made. This is akin to that. Honestly, I would have bought Homeworld in a heartbeat without any spiffy new graphics. I have been playing PC games since Zork and this is one of only a few that really, really stood out in my mind. As soon as GOG came on the scene I was regularly checking to see if they had this game. Maybe it just shone so bright considering the time it was released in. Kinda like Star Wars. When I was ten and saw Star Wars I was floored. Nothing like it had ever been seen. When I showed it to my niece and nephews they were all kinda ""meh"". Perhaps today Homeworld will be viewed similarly by the current generation of gamers. I hope not though. I hope it is enjoyed by the current gaming crowd as much as it was by us 15 years ago. It really is an outstanding game. Hall of Fame stuff and a true high water mark in gaming. As the poster above me said it really is a solid as shit RTS. I just played Grey Goo (latest RTS game) and it was a fun game. I really enjoyed it. I would dump it in in a heartbeat for Homeworld. A bit of apples and oranges there and I do not mean to dump on Grey Goo which really is pretty good. Just not the same league. If you haven't noticed I am very excited for this release. I even took a day off work for it (to be fair a day off for me has been a long time coming)."	its really a shining monument of rts history imo absolutely indeed a shining monument to computer gaming of any sort like some older music there are a few bands a few songs that stand the test of time and are as good now as the day they were made this is akin to that honestly i would have bought homeworld in a heartbeat without any new graphics i have been playing pc games since and this is one of only a few that really really stood out in my mind as soon as gog came on the scene i was regularly checking to see if they had this game maybe it just shone so bright considering the time it was released in kinda like star wars when i was ten and saw star wars i was floored nothing like it had ever been seen when i showed it to my niece and nephews they were all kinda meh perhaps today homeworld will be viewed similarly by the current generation of gamers i hope not though i hope it is enjoyed by the current gaming crowd as much as it was by us years ago it really is an outstanding game hall of fame stuff and a true high water mark in gaming as the poster above me said it really is a solid as shit rts i just played grey goo latest rts game and it was a fun game i really enjoyed it i would dump it in in a heartbeat for homeworld a bit of apples and oranges there and i do not mean to dump on grey goo which really is pretty good just not the same league if you haven t noticed i am very excited for this release i even took a day off work for it to be fair a day off for me has been a long time coming 	0.138	0.2032	316	0

What are the worst things about depression, in your opinion? I can't decide between these: 1) The feeling of dread simply living can give you. Remember that feeling in your stomach you'd get as a kid when you know tomorrow you'd have to go to the doctor and get a shot? Sometimes I get that feeling just knowing I have things to do the next day. 2) Rumination. Living through a bad experience once is quite enough, I don't need to think about it years after the fact. 3) Maybe this is more anxiety, but I can't handle things. Something that would only give most people mere annoyance for a couple days will turn me into a hyperventilating mess.

Am I fucking myself up by not transitioning? I (20 AFAB) identify as genderqueer and transmasculine. I have done nothing to transition, medically or socially, because I don't want to risk my family for it. My mom got three sons and me and has made it clear that she will not support transition. Recently I've started to realize that I have a lot of symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder. One of the symptoms is inconsistent identity. I bounce around from full male to almost female identity all the time, but it doesn't feel the way genderfluid is often described; it's harsh and difficult and hurtful and confusing, not fluid at all. I also have depression and anxiety. I was reading the post about dysphoria and it's effects on you without you knowing and I was just wondering if this could be at all self inflicted. I know you guys and gals aren't trained mental health counselors but if you know anything, please share.

Same should go for weed, legal or not. But you aren't fired Monday because of a can of beer you had Friday after work. You shouldn't be fired Monday because you had a joint Friday night. That's none of your boss's business. If you come to work hungover on anything, you should be fired. But just because you partake when you're off work doesn't mean you come in high or hungover. Hell, I got drunk last night.

"I don't know why these people don't like words. They have to put emotion into everything. For example, the word victim. It means you were the hurt or oppressed subject of a crime or other malicious activity. It's just a term. Recently I was told I'm not allowed to say rape victim anymore. I have to say target. Not sexual assault victim, it has to be sexual assault target. But WTF's wrong with victim? It just means you were taken advantage of. And you were. Nothing is shameful about it, it's just a term.

Bioshock Infinite It is sadly a polished turd that I regret having paid 20 for, an assortment of the usual shooter clichs wrapped into high quality artsy visual design (though for some reason, all paintings have stucko texture, not paintbrush texture) - Dishonored is easily 10 times as good. The sound design is remarkably bad, as everything sounds like it's squeezed through a brutal dynamic-compressor cranked up to 15, while additionally a set of high frequencies (I guess around 5 KHz) are boosted so much that it's just unpleasant and can only be beared by reducing the volume, and this is *not* to be confused with just being too loud. The intro movies and too small FoV slider range can easily be fixed via settings-file-adjustment (for this and other tips, see [here](http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/03/27/bioshock-infinite-tweaks-let-you-skip-intro-videos-increase-fov-and-adjust-sensitivity/)), but be warned that the savegame system is *abysmal*, you only have far apart checkpoints between which you can easily have a lot of individual small activities (looking for the few kinds of existing goodies in trashcans etc.), and all those will be lost when you quit out of frustration to play something else, which can easily happen as you can easily miss such an autosave having happened. Supposedly, this game is a descendant of System Shock and the much better System Shock 2, and while I see that they obviously took a few elements of those games, the game itself has nothing to do with those classics, it's a flat out lie to claim that it's actually a descendant, and if I purely use enjoyment as a measure, the game is at most worth 10 (rather 5, but the design, the sky-city, the pleasant companion experience, and most of all the curiosity as to how the story will continue (something the first play-through will kill) motivate a lot).	bioshock infinite it is sadly a polished turd that i regret having paid for an assortment of the usual shooter clichs wrapped into high quality artsy visual design though for some reason all paintings have texture not paintbrush texture dishonored is easily times as good the sound design is remarkably bad as everything sounds like it s squeezed through a brutal dynamic compressor cranked up to while additionally a set of high frequencies i guess around khz are boosted so much that it s just unpleasant and can only be by reducing the volume and this is *not* to be confused with just being too loud the intro movies and too small fov slider range can easily be fixed via settings file adjustment for this and other tips see here but be warned that the savegame system is you only have far apart checkpoints between which you can easily have a lot of individual small activities looking for the few kinds of existing goodies in trashcans etc and all those will be lost when you quit out of frustration to play something else which can easily happen as you can easily miss such an autosave having happened supposedly this game is a descendant of system shock and the much better system shock and while i see that they obviously took a few elements of those games the game itself has nothing to do with those classics it s a flat out lie to claim that it s actually a descendant and if i purely use enjoyment as a measure the game is at most worth rather but the design the sky city the pleasant companion experience and most of all the curiosity as to how the story will continue something the first play through will kill motivate a lot 	0.025	0.5969	299	0

Hm...well I did include them one by one, and they do help - for a while. But like I said, every few weeks I'll have bad skin. Is it possible the products could cause this? I assumed products that clog my skin would consistently clog my skin. What products would you recommend I cut? I didn't have my AHA toner for a few days and my skin was just awful, so I don't want to cut that. But I could experiment going with the snail bee essence, because I'm not sure it really does much.	hm well i did include them one by one and they do help for a while but like i said every few weeks i ll have bad skin is it possible the products could cause this ? i assumed products that clog my skin would consistently clog my skin what products would you recommend i cut ? i didn t have my aha toner for a few days and my skin was just awful so i don t want to cut that but i could experiment going with the snail bee essence because i m not sure it really does much 	-0.1889	0.5315	101	1
Not entirely the most extreme pain I have been in but the most unbearable has been the last 9 months or so. I have a bunch of chronic pain conditions that I have had my whole life but it wasn't until last year that it got bad. I had to leave my job and my home with my boyfriend and dog to go 2000 miles for treatment. I may be here for a year or however long it takes to get disability. Some days I can do shit but other days I can't even put a shirt on because the movement is too painful. I am a 23 year old female and I look healthy so my pain gets downplayed by lots of people including doctors. I have a connective tissue disorder so my tendons and ligaments don't really do their jobs. Which means my muscles are extra strained and my joints are really bad. I basically feel like I got hit by a car the day before. Every day. I have osteoarthritis, POTS, CRPS,TMJ, and autonomic dysfunction, among other things. So when I stand up I get dizzy and lose my vision for a minute. I get fevers all the time because my body can't regulate temperature as well as some other things that should happen automatically. Even trying to pee is difficult. None of my body doesn't hurt. Even my skin and nail beds. Basically everything I do is significantly more difficult to do than it is for most people. Sometimes I can't stay awake, other times I can't sleep. Even my low pain days I have no energy. It's not necessarily the worst pain, but the fact that it is every day makes it absolutely unbearable. The toll it has taken on my mental health is just as big of an issue. I went insane for a while before I got antidepressants. Even with them I'm not great. I basically don't get to take part in my life. So yeah this is by far the worst pain I have had to deal with.	not entirely the most extreme pain i have been in but the most unbearable has been the last months or so i have a bunch of chronic pain conditions that i have had my whole life but it wasn t until last year that it got bad i had to leave my job and my home with my boyfriend and dog to go miles for treatment i may be here for a year or however long it takes to get disability some days i can do shit but other days i can t even put a shirt on because the movement is too painful i am a year old female and i look healthy so my pain gets downplayed by lots of people including doctors i have a connective tissue disorder so my tendons and ligaments don t really do their jobs which means my muscles are extra strained and my joints are really bad i basically feel like i got hit by a car the day before every day i have osteoarthritis pots crps tmj and autonomic dysfunction among other things so when i stand up i get dizzy and lose my vision for a minute i get fevers all the time because my body can t regulate temperature as well as some other things that should happen automatically even trying to pee is difficult none of my body doesn t hurt even my skin and nail beds basically everything i do is significantly more difficult to do than it is for most people sometimes i can t stay awake other times i can t sleep even my low pain days i have no energy it s not necessarily the worst pain but the fact that it is every day makes it absolutely unbearable the toll it has taken on my mental health is just as big of an issue i went insane for a while before i got antidepressants even with them i m not great i basically don t get to take part in my life so yeah this is by far the worst pain i have had to deal with 	-0.1193	0.6401	354	1

"eighth grade, I had this old woman in her 70's who taught philosophy. The class consisted of her lecturing for an hour and a half (she used to be a college prof.) and everyone playing games and sleeping. I usually tried to pay attention, but it was on and off. One day she decided to have a ""philosophical"" discussion, I forget what it was about.

"The thing I have legit interest in, I would hate to work into that. I hate doing things I like when there is stress or when it involves other people. Right now, I am taking care of a child (I love it), and when the parents are around, I literally just sit and watch the kid. As soon as they're gone, I turn into the cool friend/entertainer/teacher he might like. All this because I feel super anxious around people, but if I'm alone with children or animals, I'm totally okay. I could teach young children, but I obviously won't be alone with those kids. Funny thing is that I wouldn't mind being filmed at all. I almost hope the family I am working with has a nanny cam or mics somewhere, so they know I don't neglect their child. I also like astronomy, but I suck in maths, never had proper science courses either. I would, again, hate to study it because yeah. I don't want to study it. I just want to lose my shit over the fact that we have a robot heading towards Pluto right now, or that we will eventually send another one on Venus, or we have a couple on Mars ... etc. I once took a geography course because I am into it, but after that course, despite doing really well (so to avoid the argument ""maybe you hate it because you failed""), I hated geography for a while. Hmmm what else. I like ... games? I actually like playing one game, but it's been a while since I last played it. I wish to start again, but I'm scared to lose interest. That's about it.

"My glorious fail as an Executioner So, this one I just HAD to share. I was playing a classic game and ended up as executioner. One of my less preferred roles, but whatever. I tried a stupid old trick and said day 2 that I had, as an inestigator, found out that my target was mayor or gf and we should lynch him if he could not reveal. So far, so boring. But then that guy actually revealed himself :( Not only he was with a chance of 1 to 8 the Random Townie, but also with a chance of 1 to 13 a mayor when random. So the rest of the game was pretty much impossible to win for me. The mayor somehow never got killed at night and I could'nt manage to get my town to lynch a revealed mayor.

"The coffee lawsuit is an urban legend. If you know the facts, it's pretty clear that McDonald's deserved the punitive damages: Trial testimony showed that at 180 to 190 degrees, McDonald's coffee was much hotter than that served by other restaurants or by people in their homes. **The fast-food chain had received at least 700 complaints about hot coffee in the previous decade and had paid more than half a million dollars in settlements**, according to trial testimony cited by the Wall Street Journal. Liebeck's injuries were hardly minor. She suffered third-degree burns on her thighs and groin area, was hospitalized for a week and had to undergo painful skin grafts. **Before filing a lawsuit, she wrote McDonald's requesting that it lower the temperature of its coffee and cover her uninsured medical bills and incidental costs of about $20,000. McDonald's offered $800**. Later, as the case neared trial, a mediator recommended that McDonald's pay a settlement of $225,000. The company refused. Jurors ultimately awarded Liebeck $160,000 in compensatory damages and about $2.7 million in punitive damages. ""The facts were so overwhelmingly against the company,"" one of the jurors told the Journal.

Do you ever have tea in a Chinese restaurant? If you like that, it is typically an oolong. If you like coffee, I'd recommend an Assam or even a breakfast tea.

Harny and Sons has some decent ones, Twinings is a UK standard and is pretty good too. I love their Prince of Wales tea. It is strong but still has nice subtle notes. And their Irish and English breakfast teas are very nice. Strong, but tasty. And try a decent darjeeling if you get a chance too.

"I (34f) think my marriage of 9 years has just ended. I just need people to talk to. I posted here under a throwaway in the last few days (mythrowawayisaokay) describing how my marriage was going through a lot of problems. I have been suffering with an ovarian cyst for the kast week and today at about 3pm, it got really bad with pain, nausea, chills. My husband was out playing vollyball/wallyball with friends at work, and I knew I couldn't reach him until he got home. I also knew he was planning on going out tonight with friends from work. I called my friend and told her the situation, and asked if she would watch the kids, if he dropped me off at the ER (only place I can get meds and nausea meds at this time in the evening) and then went on to his night out. She was fine with this. When he got home I told him how I was feeling and he asked was my phone charged in case I needed to call him to go to the ER in the night. I said that I felt that I needed to go now and that I had sorted childcare so he could still go out. He got a bit stroppy and said he would cancel his night out if I needed to go to the hospital now so he could watch the kids. I told him I had sorted childcare and he didn't need to cancel. I felt he was getting angry at me for making him cancel so I told him to just go out and that I would sort myself out. Stupid I know, I should have just gone with it and taken him being moody for the next few months. He started getting ready and I went to lay down on the bed with a bowl as I felt really sick. The kids (4 and 7) were coming in and out asking if they could look after me. I was trying to make them see I was ok (but not actually ok) so they wouldn't worry and agreed they could stay up for a while to help me. He told them they had to go to bed ""to help me out"" and the kids got upset because he was telling them the opposite of what I had said. He then got mad because the kids were asking me what to do. He told them to do ""whatever"" because they were not going to listen to him anyway. The kids were upset that he was getting angry so i sent them off to play. He started getting mad because I was trying not to throw up, and really upset with the pain and his attitude. He told me that I always ruin his plans to go out with his friends. I asked him when this had last happened and he told me last July. The story behind that is that I went out with friends, drank too much, ended up with my drink being spiked and taken to hospital. After that I was having really bad anxiety attacks for a week after and he stayed home with me to look after me. Apparently he was supposed to go out at some pint then, but cancelled it to be with me. Nothing since then has stopped him going out. He also told me that he is fed up that 'every year' I have to go to hospital for one thing or another and he has to take care of me. Last year I was in hospital because of the night out, and I also got very sick with a separate ovarian cyst which had to be surgically removed. What he forgets is that I also had my tubes cut at the same time so that he didnt have to have a vasectomy after deciding our family was complete. I was not in hospital the year before. The last time I was in hospital for anything (to my memory) was in 2009 when I was giving birth to our youngest child. I just don't know what is goin on in his mind right now, but he was yelling at me for always ruining his time. The kids heard him yelling and came in telling him to stop making me cry. They were relly upset and once I had got them calmed down and off to do a 'job' for me, I told him he had lost any chance he had with me, that I was not going to let him upset me or the kids like that again. That he had friends waiting out in the street to go out and that he should just go. He started saying that he would cancel going out, but that he had a 8am meeting and he didn't want to be coming out in the middle of the night to pick me up when I got discharged. I told him to just go. I don't need to be guilt tripped into not going to hospital by my own husband. I certainly said some things tonight that were horrible to him. I told him exactly how I felt he was treating me. I told him that as far as I was cincerned, he had made up his mind about whether he wanted to be in this marriage or not. Pain does stupid things to people, so maybe I will regret this tomorrow. Or the day after. But I will not let him hurt the kids like he did tonight. They both came in for big cuddles once he had left, I told them they can talk to e about anything and I wont be upset or mad if they have questions. The 4 year old just wante some cuddles and reassurance, the 7 year old was much more upset and worried, althoug she was not able to express her worries. I have told her she can talk to me any time. I talked about how sometimes they fight and argue and shout at each other, and that sometimes silly grownups do that too. But that we I will always protect them and love them and be there for them. I just need to get through this pain and sickness tonight, then in the morning I can drop my youngest at daycare and my friend has said she will have my eldest so that I can get medical help. If things get worse in the night I will just have to do what I can to manage. I just need people to talk to me tonight and keep me sane. Right now I feel that I am holding on to my sanity by a thread and the pain (emotional and physical) is so bad I want to scream. TLDR: I think my marriage is over, I am in immense physical and emotional pain. Get me through the night please. **edit** sorry for the horrible typos and spelling"	i f think my marriage of years has just ended i just need people to talk to i posted here under a throwaway in the last few days describing how my marriage was going through a lot of problems i have been suffering with an ovarian cyst for the week and today at about it got really bad with pain nausea chills my husband was out playing with friends at work and i knew i couldn t reach him until he got home i also knew he was planning on going out tonight with friends from work i called my friend and told her the situation and asked if she would watch the kids if he dropped me off at the er only place i can get meds and nausea meds at this time in the evening and then went on to his night out she was fine with this when he got home i told him how i was feeling and he asked was my phone charged in case i needed to call him to go to the er in the night i said that i felt that i needed to go now and that i had sorted childcare so he could still go out he got a bit and said he would cancel his night out if i needed to go to the hospital now so he could watch the kids i told him i had sorted childcare and he didn t need to cancel i felt he was getting angry at me for making him cancel so i told him to just go out and that i would sort myself out stupid i know i should have just gone with it and taken him being moody for the next few months he started getting ready and i went to lay down on the bed with a bowl as i felt really sick the kids and were coming in and out asking if they could look after me i was trying to make them see i was ok but not actually ok so they wouldn t worry and agreed they could stay up for a while to help me he told them they had to go to bed to help me out and the kids got upset because he was telling them the opposite of what i had said he then got mad because the kids were asking me what to do he told them to do whatever because they were not going to listen to him anyway the kids were upset that he was getting angry so i sent them off to play he started getting mad because i was trying not to throw up and really upset with the pain and his attitude he told me that i always ruin his plans to go out with his friends i asked him when this had last happened and he told me last july the story behind that is that i went out with friends drank too much ended up with my drink being spiked and taken to hospital after that i was having really bad anxiety attacks for a week after and he stayed home with me to look after me apparently he was supposed to go out at some pint then but cancelled it to be with me nothing since then has stopped him going out he also told me that he is fed up that every year i have to go to hospital for one thing or another and he has to take care of me last year i was in hospital because of the night out and i also got very sick with a separate ovarian cyst which had to be surgically removed what he

"Hope - Little Jane Doe https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Jane_Doe The St. Louis Jane Doe is an unidentified girl who was found murdered on February 28, 1983 in St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri. She has also been nicknamed ""Hope"" and the ""Little Jane Doe.""[1] The victim was estimated to be between eight and eleven when she was murdered, presumably by strangulation. The victim had also been decapitated and raped; the brutality of the crime has led to national attention. Reading about how [Vernon Brown](http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/brown967.htm) killed his victims, I believe it's very possible she was one of his victims. This case has always got to me because I always have a hard time understanding how a child goes without being identified. To think she might not have had family looking for her. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzNt6YfGNX4 Here is a video that shows the only photo I know of of the body. It isn't graphic, it's only a photo of her hands tied behind her, but knowing the context makes it 100X worse."	hope little jane doe the st louis jane doe is an unidentified girl who was found murdered on in st louis st louis county missouri she has also been nicknamed hope and the little jane doe the victim was estimated to be between eight and eleven when she was murdered presumably by strangulation the victim had also been decapitated and raped the brutality of the crime has led to national attention reading about how vernon brown killed his victims i believe it s very possible she was one of his victims this case has always got to me because i always have a hard time understanding how a child goes without being identified to think she might not have had family looking for her here is a video that shows the only photo i know of of the body it isn t graphic it s only a photo of her hands tied behind her but knowing the context makes it x worse 	-0.1514	0.5217	162	1

I think he's just overall frustrated with her. She keeps making him do extracurricular activities he doesn't want to do. She's one of those people who makes everyone feel like everything is their fault, everything has to be her way, everyone has to do what she wants, etc, and that combined with her other personality traits makes a person simply get sick of her really quickly.

How are you when you don't eat for 24+ hours? Sorry this sounds like an odd question, but I haven't eaten in 22 hours now. Actually, lately, I've been eaten way less often than I'm used to, and almost every day I feel like I'm on the verge of death. I don't know how normal it is. Symptoms usually include a really bad migraine, feeling like head is too heavy for my body, burps (not uncomfortable but I guess worth mentioning), ringing in the ears, and an overall feeling of weakness. But I feel like 22 hours is very few for this type of reaction? ** By the way, it's not that I don't want to eat. I'm the biggest food lover in the world. It's just that the circumstances I'm in I've led me to eat less than usual, sometimes not at all for a full day.	how are you when you don t eat for hours ? sorry this sounds like an odd question but i haven t eaten in hours now actually lately i ve been eaten way less often than i m used to and almost every day i feel like i m on the verge of death i don t know how normal it is symptoms usually include a really bad migraine feeling like head is too heavy for my body not uncomfortable but i guess worth mentioning ringing in the ears and an overall feeling of weakness but i feel like hours is very few for this type of reaction ? by the way it s not that i don t want to eat i m the biggest food lover in the world it s just that the circumstances i m in i ve led me to eat less than usual sometimes not at all for a full day 	-0.1273	0.4157	157	1

"Rant: Probably failed a class my advisor is pissed and I probably deserve it. burner account is obviously a burner So I'm an engineering grad from a physics background, and was convinced, against the suggestion of the professor teaching the course, to take a strictly engineer type course my first year here. NEedless to say it was going awfully, but the department decided not to let me drop without revoking my TA, so again under the advice of my advisor, I pushed on. I'm not sure if it's the ADHD or if I'm just fucking stupid, but despite throwing myself at the class and focusing solely on the class, I bombed the fuck out of the final. My advisor just called (it's 11pm) to ask how my exam went, and when I told him that I did better than the midterm but not nearly as well as I hoped, he didn't take it well. Instead of being his normal ""swear at you and question your manhood"" self, he just got quiet, and hung up on me. I gave it everything I had, but after weeks of studying and a hell of a mental breakdown last night, it just wasn't enough. I don't know if I'm just too fucking stupid, or if I'm willfully trying to screw myself over, but my advisor's voice had that ""you could die for all I care, I'm disappointing and I'm done with you"" tone to it, and if I didn't hate myself before well after two semesters of this I sure as fuck sake do now.

Steam game icons messing up. Why is this happening? http://i.imgur.com/QrhmP.png Every time I restart my computer, any Steam game icon looks like an IE page instead. I can give it a short term fix by manually changing the icon, but it ends up changing back when I restart again. I tried the ClientRegistry.blob trick, and made new desktop icons, but only L4D2 and MTG actually fixed, and when I restarted later, the L4D2 icon was back to the IE icon. Steam is updated, I've verified the integrity and all that. It's not impairing my ability to play the games at all, but it looks ugly and I hate it. Googling the problem hasn't helped beyond a short term fix. I could just not have icons on my desktop, but I like having them there. As you can see, it only happens with Steam game shortcuts. If I link directly to the game instead of through Steam, it has a normal icon, but then it doesn't play through Steam. Any help you could offer would be awesome. Thank you.	steam game icons messing up why is this happening ? every time i restart my computer any steam game icon looks like an ie page instead i can give it a short term fix by manually changing the icon but it ends up changing back when i restart again i tried the blob trick and made new desktop icons but only l4d2 and mtg actually fixed and when i restarted later the l4d2 icon was back to the ie icon steam is updated i ve verified the integrity and all that it s not my ability to play the games at all but it looks ugly and i hate it googling the problem hasn t helped beyond a short term fix i could just not have icons on my desktop but i like having them there as you can see it only happens with steam game shortcuts if i link directly to the game instead of through steam it has a normal icon but then it doesn t play through steam any help you could offer would be awesome thank you 	-0.0896	0.547	181	1

I agree that they're dealing with different entities, and the levels may not be the same. My main point is that regulators capitulating to the entities they are supposed to regulate absolutely has precedents, especially when money is involved. This happens in the financial industry, in the oil industry, in the mining industry, telecom, etc - every industry. While I agree it may not be to a comparable level, I find the assertion that it doesn't happen at all to be suspect given the precedents. Your original statement was: If his book details actual cheating then why aren't they being prosecuted? **Do you think regulators just willingly turn a blind eye to this? Why would they do that?** Like I said, there are precedents that greed or regulatory culture would motivate regulators to turn a blind eye to malfeasance. That was the statement I was responding to with the example to show that it does happen. The entities are less important than the fact that regulators can and do ignore things that they should be stopping.	i agree that they re dealing with different entities and the levels may not be the same my main point is that regulators to the entities they are supposed to regulate absolutely has precedents especially when money is involved this happens in the financial industry in the oil industry in the mining industry telecom etc every industry while i agree it may not be to a comparable level i find the assertion that it doesn t happen at all to be suspect given the precedents your original statement was if his book details actual cheating then why aren t they being prosecuted ? do you think regulators just willingly turn a blind eye to this ? why would they do that ? like i said there are precedents that greed or regulatory culture would motivate regulators to turn a blind eye to malfeasance that was the statement i was responding to with the example to show that it does happen the entities are less important than the fact that regulators can and do ignore things that they should be stopping 	0.0173	0.0	180	0

Work Can Hurt Too So some background first. I work in an office as a facilities assistant. That basically means I'm the Break Room Fairy. I stock up the break rooms in the morning, check/set up the conference rooms, deliver mail, that sort of thing. This typically means I'm on my feet all day. As someone with early onset arthritis in one of my knees, this can become quite painful. However, today was different. I was delivering some packages, and went to turn around on my heel, a motion I have made thousands of times around here. The only difference? I somehow twisted wrong, and my knee explodes into an instant ten on the pain scale. I couldn't move, nor could I call out. My coworkers don't know I have these knee problems, and letting them know would be bad, as it's only my fifth week on this job. After a few minutes, the pain subsided to an easy seven, but has remained there since. This happened about an hour ago, and every time I go to turn, instant ten again. I just don't know what to do, I'm hoping someone can help? Maybe a couple of pointers, other than not turning on that leg? As I work in an office, it's incredibly difficult to not move and turn this way and that....

I see all the people who habitually surrender out of their games posting here, and I understand that you wouldn't want to be penalized, but the game ending and the lobby popping up before the game is over is penalization for those that dont have endless time to play. Some of us dont get to get home from school/work and just veg on smite. The people who want to play a game through to the end are already copping a punishment, so why should the people who cant make it a whole game be off scott free?

Going in for surgery tomorrow. Could use an internet hug. I am having an exploratory laparoscopy tomorrow to try and find the cause of intense abdominal pain that I have been having for a month now. I hate having general anaesthetics, I get very anxious and scared and my worst case scenario thinking comes out in full force. I am struggling to stay calm about it tonight. Even though I know it is a relatively minor procedure, they will not know what they need to do to resolve any problems until they are in there. I know my surgeon and trust her, but it is still scary to me and I am going over all the things that could go wrong in my head. It is not helping that I am having to take strong painkillers and they are clouding my ability to process my thoughts logically. I am going to be a nervous wreck going in there, and last time I remember crying as they put me under because I was so scared that I was never going to wake up again. So I am feeling miserable and in pain and just looking for a bit of support and sympathy :-( **edit** So I am home safe and sound, but minus one ovary. I will find out more tomorrow when my surgeon cals. Thanks for all the hugs and comments of to take my mahooosive painkillers now xxxx **edit** **2** so it was a twisted fallopian tube abd scar tissue surrounding the ovary.

So what are you waiting for? I'm 99% sure that you are not a working psychologist, though there must be a few bad ones out there. I'm 100% sure you have never been through depression. That is absolutely not how it works.. you are telling someone who appears to have a chemical imbalance in their brain to 'snap out of it'. People with depression will struggle desperately to get out of bed, take a shower or do some work for hours. OP even tells you he struggles for two hours each day to stand up- if he could just get over that don't you think he has tried it already? As someone who was clinically depressed I thought I was lazy for a very long time, but it didn't make sense to me because I tried so hard and wanted to do so badly the things that I used to do with ease. Shame on you for not admitting your ignorance and possibly making this guys struggle even worse.

"It would be a tie between my Antique copy of Larousse Gastronomique, and a really interesting one called ""[In Memory's Kitchen](http://www.amazon.com/In-Memorys-Kitchen-Legacy-Terezin/dp/0742546462)."" Neither one is a traditional ""cookbook"". Larousse is an encyclopedia that happens to have a lot of recipes in it, and my edition, 2nd, edition still has all of the cool quips and jokes before the editors advised they be removed. In Memory's Kitchen is... different. It is a compilation of recipes, written from memory, during the holocaust by concentration camp victims. I love both because the recipes are very often just general guidelines. They aren't like modern recipes where you are walked step-by-step through every detail. Rather, you'll see an ingredient list and then ""assemble like a pudding"" or ""prepare like a cookie."" They are difficult, and you often have to do work. In the case of In Memory's Kitchen, a number of the recipes were written by people who were terrified for their lives and on on the brink of starvation, so some of the ingredients make no sense.

"Flippity floppity go her labia minora as Kathy Ireland runs from the big hard rapist. It, the fli-fluh, was happening her labia majora were ineffectual in preventing. But on this rapish night, her inspiringly long vaginal lips, which had on so many occasions caused her grief and visits to the ground via tripping, was to be an advantage. Flip flap, flip flap, she runs. And the rape man follows. Kate, who, in her state if panicked confusion, at that very moment decided she would begin (surviving this of course) the paperwork necessary to finally change her name to how she'd always wanted it, ""Mommy Longlips"", turned to take a great good gander at her pursuer. She saw him bouldering towards her, big and black in the night. It's when she saw the wart on his junk, gleaming by the headlights of the cars who would pass by and honk and speed away, that she really, I mean REALLY, got to running. Flip flap flip flap, flofloflofloflo, uh oh, what's this? her lips are - no - they're acting as a set of wings! Look! Hark! There she goes! Propelled away by the beefy things that caused her to become a target for the mad rapist now shaking his fist powerlessly at the sky where she flies in the first place. Where will she go? To what extent, exactly, does she have control over her newfound, and glorious, brown-winged mode of transport?

Should some actions on the field (court etc.) be treated as a criminal offence? I was just wondering what people's thoughts are on this. I've often wondered in the past why people who play sports seem to get away with doing things on the field (or whatever they play on), that would get them arrested if they were to do it in the street. I know that the players often receive fines and bans from their respective ruling organistaions, but is it always enough? In some cases it's obviously difficult to tell whether there was malicious intent - for example, a really badly timed tackle. But there are other times where it's much more clear cut that someone has overstepped the mark to the point where it could be considered a criminal offence i.e. punching, kicking, biting etc. An incident I remember well was when Duncan Ferguson was jailed for 3 months for [this] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOk8mZhX0Jk) head butt, after the police on duty at the match charged him for it. Do you think it's something that should happen? Or should incidents like that be dealt with by the respective organisations, and left at that? Obviously, I've started this thread in light of the Suarez incident today, but I don't mean this as a witch hunt against him, I do mean this in a general way.	should some actions on the field court etc be treated as a criminal offence ? i was just wondering what people s thoughts are on this i ve often wondered in the past why people who play sports seem to get away with doing things on the field or whatever they play on that would get them arrested if they were to do it in the street i know that the players often receive fines and bans from their respective ruling but is it always enough ? in some cases it s obviously difficult to tell whether there was malicious intent for example a really badly timed tackle but there are other times where it s much more clear cut that someone has overstepped the mark to the point where it could be considered a criminal offence i e punching kicking biting etc an incident i remember well was when duncan ferguson was jailed for months for this head butt after the police on duty at the match charged him for it do you think it s something that should happen ? or should incidents like that be dealt with by the respective organisations and left at that ? obviously i ve started this thread in light of the suarez incident today but i don t mean this as a witch hunt against him i do mean this in a general way 	-0.1147	0.587	232	1
I think I'm at my lowest point with my pain. Everything feels gross and hopeless. There's just nothing. My tramadol stopped working so I stopped taking. I wasn't on it for very long but it is definitely effecting me coming out of my system. I had weird dreams last night when I finally managed to sleep for a couple hours. Now I still feel all gross about it. My mom is being awful and it is the worst timing. I just want to go home back to my life. I want to try Lyrica and maybe that will help.

Now I don't even really have any options or they all seem like bad ones. This is MY life. I demand the right to fuck it up on my own or have enough control to actually make it work.

"Yes. It's stupid. Your feelings are your feelings, and implying that someone is moody because they're female is just a way to undermine someone's feelings. You're basically saying that ""you have a vagina, your feelings don't matter."" It's really sad when women say this too, because it's just internalized misogyny. In the same vein, I hate whenever I (or another female) is angry or upset about something and some douchebag says it must be because I'm on my period. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize that I was only allowed to be angry about things while bleeding from my vagina and all the rest of the time I should be happy and perky constantly."	yes it s stupid your feelings are your feelings and implying that someone is moody because they re female is just a way to undermine someone s feelings you re basically saying that you have a vagina your feelings don t matter it s really sad when women say this too because it s just internalized misogyny in the same vein i hate whenever i or another female is angry or upset about something and some douchebag says it must be because i m on my period oh i m sorry i didn t realize that i was only allowed to be angry about things while bleeding from my vagina and all the rest of the time i should be happy and perky constantly 	-0.2333	0.6408	124	1
This is probably my most hated thing about being a female. For a while I had to ride my bike every day through the city to get to work. On an average day I would get a dozen or so cat calls. Some of them were scary, some friendly but still uncomfortable, and some were crude and disgusting. It really effected my self image for a while and made me hate leaving the house. Especially when the weather was nice and I needed to wear shorts. I am still nervous in public all the time and get freaked out when a guy walks in my direction.	this is probably my most hated thing about being a female for a while i had to ride my bike every day through the city to get to work on an average day i would get a dozen or so cat calls some of them were scary some friendly but still uncomfortable and some were crude and disgusting it really effected my self image for a while and made me hate leaving the house especially when the weather was nice and i needed to wear shorts i am still nervous in public all the time and get freaked out when a guy walks in my direction 	-0.2054	0.461	106	1

Video playback choppy, breaking. I've been noticing this for quite some time now, video's even though fully loaded tend to stutter a lot during playback. It was more profound on vimeo, when the playback stop and the video button changes from the pause button to play button. The video was fully loaded though - http://vimeo.com/48043470 - this was the video, while this thing was happening. Its also present on facebook videos, though to a lesser extent, and least on YouTube.

"Everything I've ever done wrong!!! I have depression and have been thinking about everything I've ever done wrong so here is the whole god damn fucking list of things I can't get out of my head. Number 1. - When I was younger I was really really insecure and wanted to impress other kids, especially moving to a new town and not knowing many people. I never hit anyone but I did get in a few scuffles with kids who didn't deserve it because other kids were egging me on. Man I felt so bad, because I know what it's like to get picked on. FUCK. I'm sorry. 13 years old Number 2. Told off some kids at soccer practice because they were being jerks about another kids accent. I was super mean and one of them started crying. Their parents heard me. 8 years old Number 3. Made fun of a handicap kid once because he was acting out and making a scene. His sister heard what I said and started crying. FUCK FUCK FUCK. I'm sorry. 11 years old Number 4. Once I went on a trip to Europe but our plane got delayed for stupid reasons so I missed a day on the trip and I got pissed at the lady at the airport who seriously couldn't have done anything about it. Didn't make a bit of a scene. FUCK. 16 years old. Number 5. Trying to impress people, I cheated in my fourth grade chess tournament. Everyone knew I did too. Still lost. 10 years old. Number 6. Made fun of a kid in front of his mom (who was a substitute teacher) she made me explain why I did that to her. Didn't know she was in ear shot. FUCK. Number 7. Had a stupid obsession crush on a girl when I was fourteen. When she went to the dance with another guy after turning down my invitation I cried in the bathroom. damn it. Number 8. Moved again, trying to impress people. Told a bunch of lies which include. Saying I had a friend who committed suicide. Saying I had friends who did all kinds of drugs before moving. I'm such an idiot. fourteen years old. Number 9. Lit a copy of ""The Pearl"" by john Steinbeck on fire (with gasoline) for being too straight forward with it's meaning and just a miserable book. Almost burned down my parent's garage. 16 years old. Number 10. While drunk described to my ex girlfriend's mom how I would have liked to beat up my ex's childhood friend for being such an ass on the school trip to Europe (It was holocaust tour he was an ass). Made a horrible impression. 17 years old. Number 11. Spent a summer at my Aunt's place was a moody angry teenager the whole time. Watched porn on the family computer, which they all completely knew about. Lied about where I was going sometimes. 15 years old. Damn it. Number 12. When george bush visited my state I was in class and watching it on tv, when the motorcade went by the cameras I said ""common snipers!"" teacher screamed at me. I was a very opinionated 12 year old. I got sent to the principle's office. 12 years old Number 13. Got drunk and chased my friends around, got sick and made a scene. 16 years old. Number 14. Lied about going to a concert, when asked about specifics by someone who went I lied and they called me out on not going. So fucking awful. 19 years old.

I used to when I was younger but it has changed now. For me the problem with living at night was that it was impossible to hold down a job in my area of expertise. This is the reason that I am always trying to sleep only at night. I also found it also makes having friends difficult as they are on a different schedule. I found that it also gets very lonely (and sometimes cold if you can't afford heating) at night when there is no-one else about. I haven't managed to succeed yet but I try to stay in a 'normal' routine now. Sometimes I get lucky and can hold it for a month or so before it it gets difficult. I then have to 'reset' things to a 'normal' pattern which is very annoying and sometimes difficult.	i used to when i was younger but it has changed now for me the problem with living at night was that it was impossible to hold down a job in my area of expertise this is the reason that i am always trying to sleep only at night i also found it also makes having friends difficult as they are on a different schedule i found that it also gets very lonely and sometimes cold if you can t afford heating at night when there is no one else about i haven t managed to succeed yet but i try to stay in a normal routine now sometimes i get lucky and can hold it for a month or so before it it gets difficult i then have to reset things to a normal pattern which is very annoying and sometimes difficult 	-0.2442	0.4126	143	1

Smoking black tar heroin can stop your shitter right up. A lot of people here seem to believe that the reason your shitter gets stopped up is because we're consuming all that powder. I personally believe it's the effect of the drug and its alkaloids on your body that cause the constipation, not because of the powder physically stopping you up. I can take Bali from any vendor at 18 grams a day and shit like a pro. But if I throw red vein Sumatran into the mix, as I always do, my shitter jams right up and stops working. You could start taking a tiny 8 mg Suboxone pill once a day and you might not shit for a week, and it's certainly not because the pill is causing some sort of obstruction. It's just what opioid(ish) substances do. Am I saying consuming 50 grams a day isn't going to physically obstruct your bowels to a degree? No, it could certainly contribute, but the primary reason your shitter doesn't shit is because of the alkaloids within the leaf, not the leaf itself.	smoking black tar heroin can stop your shitter right up a lot of people here seem to believe that the reason your shitter gets stopped up is because we re consuming all that powder i personally believe it s the effect of the drug and its alkaloids on your body that cause the constipation not because of the powder physically stopping you up i can take bali from any vendor at grams a day and shit like a pro but if i throw red vein sumatran into the mix as i always do my shitter jams right up and stops working you could start taking a tiny mg suboxone pill once a day and you might not shit for a week and it s certainly not because the pill is causing some sort of obstruction it s just what opioid ish substances do am i saying consuming grams a day isn t going to physically obstruct your bowels to a degree ? no it could certainly contribute but the primary reason your shitter doesn t shit is because of the alkaloids within the leaf not the leaf itself 	0.0437	0.281	188	0

While this is factually accurate, it is untrue in it's own terms. All foetuses do *not* start out as female before some make a transition to male in utero. **This is a common misconception.** In actual fact all foetuses are naturally hermaphroditic in the womb, before developing male or female characteristics relatively late in pregnancy. Both sexes have characteristics of the other inherited from this early developmental stage; men have nipples, woman have a clitoris (this is an undeveloped penis, and can be stimulated to develop in adult females with the use of steroids) and so on. The proposition that all foetuses start as female is, though widely believed, absurd when you stop to think about it.	while this is factually accurate it is untrue in it s own terms all foetuses do *not* start out as female before some make a transition to male in utero this is a common misconception in actual fact all foetuses are naturally hermaphroditic in the womb before developing male or female characteristics relatively late in pregnancy both sexes have characteristics of the other inherited from this early developmental stage men have nipples woman have a clitoris this is an undeveloped penis and can be stimulated to develop in adult females with the use of steroids and so on the proposition that all foetuses start as female is though widely believed absurd when you stop to think about it 	-0.0016	0.125	118	0

It is incredibly difficult to not be labeled as such. I make a point of never letting my friends know whether I'm feeling depressed or not because of the same fear that you have: that they will dismiss it as 'not their problem'. Unfortunately, when I drink I let my depression come to the surface and begin ranting about the meaninglessness of existence, which I feel alienates me slightly every time. I put it down to my belief that 'normal' people are afraid of depressed individuals; we are foreign to them in our behaviour and it unsettles them, even if they try to empathise they are still unnerved a little by us. They see in us an existence that they can't fully comprehend without having been there, and attempt to visualise what it would be like for them,which scares them, and so some try to distance themselves. Just as we (speaking from my perspective) can't understand what makes them happy, they can't understand what makes us depressed all the time, and so they label us as 'The Depressed Person'.By doing this it essentially isolates what we do and how we think and classifies it as the behaviour of the depressed, something they should try not to get involved in in case our negativity 'rubs off' onto them. This is just my observation ,however, I don't even know if all this made sense.	it is incredibly difficult to not be labeled as such i make a point of never letting my friends know whether i m feeling depressed or not because of the same fear that you have that they will dismiss it as not their problem unfortunately when i drink i let my depression come to the surface and begin ranting about the meaninglessness of existence which i feel me slightly every time i put it down to my belief that normal people are afraid of depressed individuals we are foreign to them in our behaviour and it them even if they try to empathise they are still unnerved a little by us they see in us an existence that they can t fully comprehend without having been there and attempt to visualise what it would be like for them which scares them and so some try to distance themselves just as we speaking from my perspective can t understand what makes them happy they can t understand what makes us depressed all the time and so they label us as the depressed person by doing this it essentially isolates what we do and how we think and classifies it as the behaviour of the depressed something they should try not to get involved in in case our negativity rubs off onto them this is just my observation however i don t even know if all this made sense 	-0.1071	0.6424	237	1

My PVs versus the work toilet. I've made this mistake about four or five times now. I go into the work bathroom to clean a flood out of my vape, or I'm simply near/on the toilet vaping and I take apart my vape to add e-liquid, when my whole world comes to an end. I drop one of the four items I am juggling, and I hear a horid splash followed by a solid CLINK. A piece of my vape has now entered the toilet realm. I try and I try again to not let pieces of my vaporizers fall into the toilet. I even took everything apart in a cabinet in the stall not above the toilet, but that wasn't enough. I knocked over my tank, it bounced off the floor twice, and committed suic1de with the help of some angry devilish force giving it enough inertia to fling itself into the toilet. The worst is when this happens in the morning at work, and I absolutely know I will be fucked for the rest of the day. Does this happen to anyone else? Why does this have to happen to anyone to begin with. What a cruel, cruel world we live in.	my versus the work toilet i ve made this mistake about four or five times now i go into the work bathroom to clean a flood out of my vape or i m simply near on the toilet vaping and i take apart my vape to add e liquid when my whole world comes to an end i drop one of the four items i am juggling and i hear a splash followed by a solid clink a piece of my vape has now entered the toilet realm i try and i try again to not let pieces of my vaporizers fall into the toilet i even took everything apart in a cabinet in the stall not above the toilet but that wasn t enough i knocked over my tank it bounced off the floor twice and committed with the help of some angry devilish force giving it enough inertia to fling itself into the toilet the worst is when this happens in the morning at work and i absolutely know i will be fucked for the rest of the day does this happen to anyone else ? why does this have to happen to anyone to begin with what a cruel cruel world we live in 	-0.1698	0.487	207	1
I'm not proud to say this, but I've been in two. Abuse manifests itself in patterns, therefore, there is always another reason why a person easily accepts abuse. I would often make excuses for her behavior (e.g. she is just having a bad day, I made her upset, she had a rough childhood). However, none of these things are acceptable excuses for abusive behavior. The sad part about this is that he has to realize the abuse in his own mind. Once he acknowledges the abusive behavior, then he will begin to do something. The enlightenment is the hardest part.	i m not proud to say this but i ve been in two abuse manifests itself in patterns therefore there is always another reason why a person easily accepts abuse i would often make excuses for her behavior e g she is just having a bad day i made her upset she had a rough childhood however none of these things are acceptable excuses for abusive behavior the sad part about this is that he has to realize the abuse in his own mind once he acknowledges the abusive behavior then he will begin to do something the enlightenment is the hardest part 	-0.1111	0.6172	103	1

I was on them in high school and briefly when I was 12 and they didn't help. That was prozac and welbutrin. So I have done what I can to manage my depression and anxiety on my own. Then about 10 months ago I began to get sick and it kicked my depression into overdrive. I don't know what it was but I went totally crazy. I was constantly pissed off and pretty much every night I was screaming and crying and punching myself in the head/pulling hair out/or digging my nails into myself until I bled. It was really scary and I was completely unable to control myself. So I saw my doctor and she prescribed me cymbalta. Somehow I got lucky and that was just the right one. I still get depressed about things but I am not insane anymore. It doesn't make me weird or anything, I feel like it made me myself again. Now I am terrified to get off of it. I should add that it definitely suppressed my sex drive. It is actually kinda nice because usually my lebido is all over the place and driving me crazy. My boyfriend doesn't have a very high sex drive and now we're long distance so it actually works out. It also makes it hard for me to orgasm which is a little annoying.	i was on them in high school and briefly when i was and they didn t help that was prozac and welbutrin so i have done what i can to manage my depression and anxiety on my own then about months ago i began to get sick and it kicked my depression into overdrive i don t know what it was but i went totally crazy i was constantly pissed off and pretty much every night i was screaming and crying and punching myself in the head pulling hair out or digging my nails into myself until i bled it was really scary and i was completely unable to control myself so i saw my doctor and she prescribed me cymbalta somehow i got lucky and that was just the right one i still get depressed about things but i am not insane anymore it doesn t make me weird or anything i feel like it made me myself again now i am terrified to get off of it i should add that it definitely suppressed my sex drive it is actually kinda nice because usually my is all over the place and driving me crazy my boyfriend doesn t have a very high sex drive and now we re long distance so it actually works out it also makes it hard for me to orgasm which is a little annoying 	-0.0791	0.624	231	1

I never eat to celebrate. In my opinion, this cultural practice is one of the underlying causes of the increasing rates of obesity in society. People eat unhealthy snacks at parties, eat in fast food restaurants to hang out with their friends, eat 'comforting foods' at funerals... People eat as a mean of socializing all the time, and most of the time that's when they eat greasy and sugar rich foods and that's when they end up being at a caloric surplus. This is irrational, you don't need to ingest macro nutrients in order to be able to socialize with other human beings. I don't know why our society does that, but it's not normal. Humans didn't evolve to have access to such an abundant supply of food, and the human brain isn't made to eat such rewarding foods all the time like we are doing today. People in today's world have never been taught to make the difference between eating because of actual hunger and eating because of exogenous factors, such as boredom, stress or the desire to socialize.... This is only anecdotal evidence but: I work at my university's faculty lab and we are currently studying how the desire to socialize affects food intake and food consumption patterns in healthy and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rodent (naked mole-rat) subjects. And based on preliminary experiments, I can tell you that there's a great chance that we are going to find that socialization has drastic effects on how eusocial beings interact with foods.	i never eat to celebrate in my opinion this cultural practice is one of the underlying causes of the increasing rates of obesity in society people eat unhealthy snacks at parties eat in fast food restaurants to hang out with their friends eat comforting foods at funerals people eat as a mean of socializing all the time and most of the time that s when they eat greasy and sugar rich foods and that s when they end up being at a caloric surplus this is irrational you don t need to ingest macro nutrients in order to be able to socialize with other human beings i don t know why our society does that but it s not normal humans didn t evolve to have access to such an abundant supply of food and the human brain isn t made to eat such rewarding foods all the time like we are doing today people in today s world have never been taught to make the difference between eating because of actual hunger and eating because of exogenous factors such as boredom stress or the desire to socialize this is only anecdotal evidence but i work at my university s faculty lab and we are currently studying how the desire to socialize affects food intake and food consumption patterns in healthy and induced diabetic rodent naked mole rat subjects and based on preliminary experiments i can tell you that there s a great chance that we are going to find that socialization has drastic effects on how eusocial beings interact with foods 	0.1437	0.356	262	0

It's funny. Up until age 23, I had met two Jews that I knew of. All the way back in elementary school. Then when I was 23 I met my boyfriend. Then I met his family. Suddenly I went from having met two to 15+. I was shocked to read that the Holocaust brought the world's population of Jews down 0.6%. That's crazy. I knew they killed a lot of people, but I had no idea it was *that* bad.	it s funny up until age i had met two jews that i knew of all the way back in elementary school then when i was i met my boyfriend then i met his family suddenly i went from having met two to i was shocked to read that the holocaust brought the world s population of jews down that s crazy i knew they killed a lot of people but i had no idea it was *that* bad 	-0.2006	0.506	79	1

I have big boobs unfortunately, and I cannot go braless even if I wanted to. Actually, I don't even like the feeling of not having something support me. I have terrible bras though. I got fitted once in my life, and honestly I hate those well-fitted bras simply because it still feels like my boobs are swimming in a sack, when I want them to be tight and not move an inch. And ... back problems. I'm at a point where I can't walk for too long without at least carrying a backpack.

"Did Lewis and Clark bring 4-year-old children with them on their expedition? Did Magellan? Would it be a good idea? Sacajawea did. And yes, while 4 is a little young, children Wesley's age and younger were employed on exploratory vessels and warships when Columbus and Magellan were sailing around the world. We speak of ""men"" serving on those ships, but by our standards many of them were *boys*. It wasn't that uncommon for them to still be in their single digits, only eight or nine years old. http://www.thepeacefulsea.com/life-at-sea.html If I had my kids aboard the Enterprise, I'd sure be getting them off at the next starbase after the auto-destruct countdown in Where Silence Has Lease. Imagine telling your children they were going to die (or not telling them) and getting down to just a few seconds... for a normal person, that would be a traumatizing experience, but for the Enterprise crew (and civilians, and children) that's just Tuesday. So you stay home, and because ""home"" is a colony in the Borg's path, you all get assimilated. Or you don't, but the Dominion invades and you lose everything. Or the sun explodes and you all die. Or somebody is really pissed about the sun thing, so he goes back in time, comes to your world and, logically, pays you back by destroying your sun. (Man, what a stupid thing to do. Why not give Romulus a head's up so they can begin fixing the problem before it starts? Well, I guess that's why the baddy wasn't a Vulcan.) Or your kid likes to play Parisi Squares, and they get into an accident and die. Or a visiting alien brings a disease they picked up on some other planet, something undetectable and with a long incubation rate, but highly contagious, and everybody dies. (Don't think I pulled this one from an existing ST plot, so don't ask.) The point is, there are no guarantees in life. Death comes *unexpectedly*, that's kinda the whole point. You think it's gonna hit you on the Enterprise, so you decide to go sightseeing on Earth, but it turns out it's waiting for you in Samarra the whole time. Whoops. You can't really be safe, no matter where you go."	did lewis and clark bring year old children with them on their expedition ? did magellan ? would it be a good idea ? did and yes while is a little young children wesley s age and younger were employed on exploratory vessels and warships when columbus and magellan were sailing around the world we speak of men serving on those ships but by our standards many of them were it wasn t that uncommon for them to still be in their single digits only eight or nine years old if i had my kids aboard the enterprise i d sure be getting them off at the next after the auto destruct countdown in where silence has lease imagine telling your children they were going to die or not telling them and getting down to just a few seconds for a normal person that would be a traumatizing experience but for the enterprise crew and civilians and children that s just tuesday so you stay home and because home is a colony in the borg s path you all get assimilated or you don t but the dominion invades and you lose everything or the sun explodes and you all die or somebody is really pissed about the sun thing so he goes back in time comes to your world and logically pays you back by destroying your sun man what a stupid thing to do why not give a head s up so they can begin fixing the problem before it starts ? well i guess that s why the wasn t a vulcan or your kid likes to play squares and they get into an accident and die or a visiting alien brings a disease they picked up on some other planet something undetectable and with a long incubation rate but highly contagious and everybody dies don t think i pulled this one from an existing st plot so don t ask the point is there are no guarantees in life death comes that s kinda the whole point you think it s gonna hit you on the enterprise so you decide to go sightseeing on earth but it turns out it s waiting for you in the whole time whoops you can t really be safe no matter where you go 	0.0864	0.6377	384	0

"The Traveling Planet [opening] A colossal planetary orb overlooks our home. Nearly at the climax of its kiss with the rock we call Earth. Some of the most amazing shades of blue you'll ever see. Colors you don't find here. Colors artists attempt, and fail to replicate. It only peaks every 68 years, but you can always see it coming months in advance. A new star in the sky at first, then within half a year's time, the harvest moon dawns forth its peak. Some call it our planet's passing lover. Some call it the thief, as it drags our moon with it for a time before gravity can set itself right - which it always does. When it does come, it's always an exciting time here. The world seems to come together in peace for nearly a year in the common endeavor to appreciate what some hold as God's Passing Eye. It pushes the rain away from certain areas, and in others, the clouds gather and the water just won't stop falling. And then comes the twilit days and shadowless nights. By the time the Sun hits noon, the sky is eclipsed, and the blue hues don't miss anything after sun down. Some even believe the vibratory luminescence can evoke an inner potential. It truly is an experience that all should share in at least one lifetime. Sheol and I lay under the aquatic nightlight, overlooking our village of which is celebrating Peak Banquet. The festival lights give illusion that the night's excitement is nearly at its apex, paralleling the sapphire that penetrates our sky. The blue bulb emanates such an energy, causing a sense of invigoration through its very presence . Away from all the festival cheer, its song can be heard through energetic vibrations that hum only soft enough for those who listen closely - those who seek to hear. Resting next to one another, hands grasped, I can feel the vastness of the cosmic sphere reverberating through us both, nearly enhancing through our physical connection. ""They say it's getting closer, you know, Sheol gently let out. In my hypnosis, I nearly missed what she'd said. ""Uh... You don't buy into that collision course fear do you?"" I rattle off in nearly the same words I've heard from my pop time and time again. She paused for a long while, her eyes reflecting equally beautiful seas of blue back at the monster in the sky. ""I don't know...My father's been doing a lot of work at the observatory lately, and he says...something's different."" Her gaze never breaks from the atmosphere, and I have no words to say. ""He says at this rate, this might be the last cycle before...The event. Silence fills the air as what she said begins to pass over me. Fireworks can be seen popping and fading in sparkling reds and yellows near village square. The irony of it all nearly brings a smile to my face. We lay there quietly, looking directly at what some hold in highest form of natural phenomenon and beauty, and by the same means, could very well bring about our end. But the fear, the fear had not overtaken me. I know I am exactly where I'm supposed to be. Sheol clasps my hand even tighter her vision transfixed towards the endless blue; and all I can hear is that gentle hum."	the traveling planet opening a colossal planetary orb overlooks our home nearly at the climax of its kiss with the rock we call earth some of the most amazing shades of blue you ll ever see colors you don t find here colors artists attempt and fail to replicate it only peaks every years but you can always see it coming months in advance a new star in the sky at first then within half a year s time the harvest moon dawns forth its peak some call it our planet s passing lover some call it the thief as it drags our moon with it for a time before gravity can set itself right which it always does when it does come it s always an exciting time here the world seems to come together in peace for nearly a year in the common endeavor to appreciate what some hold as god s passing eye it pushes the rain away from certain areas and in others the clouds gather and the water just won t stop falling and then comes the days and shadowless nights by the time the sun hits noon the sky is eclipsed and the blue hues don t miss anything after sun down some even believe the can evoke an inner potential it truly is an experience that all should share in at least one lifetime sheol and i lay under the aquatic nightlight overlooking our village of which is celebrating peak banquet the festival lights give illusion that the night s excitement is nearly at its apex paralleling the sapphire that penetrates our sky the blue bulb such an energy causing a sense of through its very presence away from all the festival cheer its song can be heard through energetic vibrations that hum only soft enough for those who listen closely those who seek to hear resting next to one another hands grasped i can feel the vastness of the cosmic sphere reverberating through us both nearly enhancing through our physical connection they say it s getting closer you know sheol gently let out in my hypnosis i nearly missed what she d said uh you don t buy into that collision course fear do you ? i rattle off in nearly the same words i ve heard from my pop time and time again she paused for a long while her eyes reflecting equally beautiful seas of blue back at the monster in the sky i don t know my father s been doing a lot of work at the observatory lately and he says something s different her gaze never breaks from the atmosphere and i have no words to say he says at this rate this might be the last cycle before the event silence fills the air as what she said begins to pass over me fireworks can be seen popping and fading in sparkling reds and yellows near village square the irony of it all nearly brings a smile to my face we lay there quietly looking directly at what some hold in highest form of natural phenomenon and beauty and by the same means could very well bring about our end but the fear the fear had not overtaken me i know i am exactly where i m supposed to be sheol my hand even tighter her vision transfixed towards the endless blue and all i can hear is that gentle hum 	0.0831	0.3433	575	0

No problem. Not many people use or even know the term, even in the LGBTQ community, and lots of people who are pan will tell people they are bi because it's easier and people will immediately know what they're talking about. Unfortunately that causes a cycle of people not knowing the term, so people don't use it to avoid confusion, so people don't know the term, and so on. But as someone who knows the pain of having to explain their identity over and over I get why they don't use it.

I've recently started seeking counselling for my issues, I think I may have BPD. Due to some recent circumstances I've started seeking counselling. I've gone to see a psychiatrist and have been diagnosed with depression and some obsessive compulsive tendencies. From what I've read I think I may have BPD. I'm a 20 year old male. Since I was little I can remember having serious mood swings. I feel very needy when it comes to other people, I'm also very afraid of them leaving me. I've had attacks of anger or crying when someone leaves me or when big plans change at the last minute. I've lied about random things because I feel insecure. Stupid things like going to a certain concert or something like that. During worse parts of my life I've had suicidal ideation and mixed with feelings of abandonment I have almost self harmed. I have threatened suicide, and have a dramatic streak when I feel I can no longer cope. I have had paranoid thoughts about almost anything you can imagine. I drink to self medicate. I always think that people close to me are just looking for an excuse to bail out of my life, and if they do leave I have major panic attacks. There's has been a pattern of people walking out on me so I'm always ready to drop someone else first, this causes problems in my relationships. I always feel a compulsion to impress people that I meet for the first time. I have fairly idealistic or black and white world views and will devalue people who disagree with me. I've been physically violent with people close to me in the past, and sometimes throw things when I'm angry. When I was younger I had a bad habit of acting out in an attempt to get others to accept me. I was bullied a lot from 8-14, partly because I believe I was already depressed at that age.	i ve recently started seeking counselling for my issues i think i may have bpd due to some recent circumstances i ve started seeking counselling i ve gone to see a psychiatrist and have been diagnosed with depression and some obsessive compulsive tendencies from what i ve read i think i may have bpd i m a year old male since i was little i can remember having serious mood swings i feel very needy when it comes to other people i m also very afraid of them leaving me i ve had attacks of anger or crying when someone leaves me or when big plans change at the last minute i ve lied about random things because i feel insecure stupid things like going to a certain concert or something like that during worse parts of my life i ve had suicidal ideation and mixed with feelings of abandonment i have almost self harmed i have threatened suicide and have a dramatic streak when i feel i can no longer cope i have had paranoid thoughts about almost anything you can imagine i drink to self medicate i always think that people close to me are just looking for an excuse to bail out of my life and if they do leave i have major panic attacks there s has been a pattern of people walking out on me so i m always ready to drop someone else first this causes problems in my relationships i always feel a compulsion to impress people that i meet for the first time i have fairly idealistic or black and white world views and will devalue people who disagree with me i ve been physically violent with people close to me in the past and sometimes throw things when i m angry when i was younger i had a bad habit of acting out in an attempt to get others to accept me i was bullied a lot from partly because i believe i was already depressed at that age 	-0.1593	0.6145	338	1

You guys are here, and that's great. I appreciate it. But support from strangers on the internet can only go so far. As far as meeting people, I don't want to meet people. I hate people. People are the reason I spend 18 hours a day locked in a room with no light and ignoring almost any call I receive on my cell phone. I can almost guarantee that forcing myself to go would do more harm than good for me. The only reason I'm even considering it is because I owe my dad big time. He is truly the *only* reason I have a roof over my head and food on my plate. He refused to abandon me when I was in desperate straits, and he goes beyond that very often (for example, allowing me to live in the house he owns, rent-free). So basically, I'll feel like shit if I don't go because he's done so much for me and I'd feel like an asshole for disappointing him. Or, I can feel like shit if I do go, because it'll be boring, because I hate crowds, I hate people, and I hate being out of my comfort zone.	you guys are here and that s great i appreciate it but support from strangers on the internet can only go so far as far as meeting people i don t want to meet people i hate people people are the reason i spend hours a day locked in a room with no light and ignoring almost any call i receive on my cell phone i can almost guarantee that forcing myself to go would do more harm than good for me the only reason i m even considering it is because i owe my dad big time he is truly the *only* reason i have a roof over my head and food on my plate he refused to abandon me when i was in desperate straits and he goes beyond that very often for example allowing me to live in the house he owns rent free so basically i ll feel like shit if i don t go because he s done so much for me and i d feel like an asshole for disappointing him or i can feel like shit if i do go because it ll be boring because i hate crowds i hate people and i hate being out of my comfort zone 	-0.1483	0.6204	208	1

"ELI5: What does it mean when a neurotransmitter's ""reuptake"" is inhibited? I searched and found [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/jtr4n/eli5_reuptake_inhibitorsantidepressants_and_how/), but I still don't get it. If, for example, a person's body has a natural lack of serotonin, why does its reuptake (absorption to the brain) need to be inhibited? Wouldn't the reuptake need to be increased, since there's so little, and the brain needs as much as possible? I feel like there's probably a simple analogy that could be used to explain this. It seems like the brain absorbing a deficient neurotransmitter is bad... but I don't understand why."	eli5 what does it mean when a neurotransmitter s reuptake is inhibited ? i searched and found this thread but i still don t get it if for example a person s body has a natural lack of serotonin why does its reuptake absorption to the brain need to be inhibited ? wouldn t the reuptake need to be increased since there s so little and the brain needs as much as possible ? i feel like there s probably a simple analogy that could be used to explain this it seems like the brain absorbing a deficient neurotransmitter is bad but i don t understand why 	-0.1625	0.422	107	1

Indeed. The unions won't surrender without a fight. They may lose, as they did under Thatcher, but simply fighting can limit the damage. It's sad that there aren't more anarchists in caucuses in some unions. There certainly are individuals, but the fact they are individuals limits their influence. I'm certainly pleased by the activities of the Solidarity Federation and the IWW in Britain, but the UK lacks the sort of 'minority caucus' represented in France by the 'Libertarian Communists of the CGT'.

As a minority, I really appreciate this post. I don't think some people realize how tough it is to be a rep for, or carry the weight of your race around day to day. I'm in college and I often check my speech or behavior, for two reasons. One, so people don't say of course a black person would get a bad grade in biochem, they're dumb and lazy. And two, so my impression doesn't make it difficult for the person of color after me. Even doing these things I've had to deal with professors making questionable comments. Sometimes I'm jealous of white people's ability to be individuals, it's quite the luxury. People take your character into account before they notice your race.

There is a thing called the Internet. And, although I starting watching when the pilot first aired, I survived 4 and a half seasons before joining Reddit. Since joining, there has rarely been a moment of the show that I missed a joke or reference. I've seen the Harmontown movie but never listened to the podcast. I have however read many many articles and follow his rants on social media. Which all will exist after the fact. I think future Community fans will be fine. Sure, they won't quite have the huge moments of joy (renewals and new instant classic episodes) and low points (delays, Cancelation threats, Dan and Chris fired, actual cancelation) but that history exists on the Internet. And anyone who finds this show and loves it, will search out the story behind it	there is a thing called the internet and although i starting watching when the pilot first aired i survived and a half seasons before joining reddit since joining there has rarely been a moment of the show that i missed a joke or reference i ve seen the movie but never listened to the podcast i have however read many many articles and follow his rants on social media which all will exist after the fact i think future community fans will be fine sure they won t quite have the huge moments of joy renewals and new instant classic episodes and low points delays cancelation threats dan and chris fired actual cancelation but that history exists on the internet and anyone who finds this show and loves it will search out the story behind it 	0.1861	0.0	136	0

"How exactly would you have handled the Iraq invasion back in 2003? As for me, I am tempted to say that I would have created a very loose Iraqi federation with three extremely autonomous parts--a Sunni one, a Shiite one, and a Kurdish one. All of these parts get a share of the Iraqi oil revenues (based on, say, their population or whatever) as well as the right to secede (in which case they gain full control of the oil on their territory but lose their rights to the revenues from oil in other parts of Iraq). If neighboring countries have a problem with this Iraqi right to secede, then I would tell them to deal with it. Also, I would have had Iraq create a Western-style constitution which would allow democracy and free elections to occur in Iraq. In addition, I most certainly would not have disbanded the entire Iraqi Army in 2003; rather, I would have only purged the ""bad apples"" (as in, those with a lot of blood on their hands) at the top of this Army. Also, before I forget, I would have also demanded that Iraq give the U.S. a part of its oil revenues in order to compensate the U.S. for its losses in Iraq. Frankly, if my approach in regards to this would have been followed, then there might have very well been no Sunni insurgency in the 2000s in Iraq and likewise no ISIS presence in Iraq right now.

Do any of you fake self confidence or arrogance to mask your depression? I've discovered that I show a fake kind of self confidence in an attempt to hide how horrible I really feel. It's almost as though I'm trying to convince myself I'm someone impressive when I know that I'm really not. It sort of happens more often during periods where I feel horrible about myself. I can convince myself to act self confident even though I'm not. It feels like an equal and opposite reaction to the depression, sort of like well if you feel like crap inside act like you're not outside. Actually it's more in line with the feeling, if you feel horrible inside, devalue everything around you so you feel better.

Well, it affects every single aspect of my life. It'd take me a day to write it out and there are multiple people that have already written articles/blogs on their own experiences. What are the biggest things for me (at the moment) have been school. I can't concentrate, I don't care about getting good grades, I don't go to class b/c I can't get out of bed, I feel sick when I get a bad grade or don't know something, I feel alone in the classroom, or i won't be able to complete a class so then i start thinking about my future and how i won't graduate because i can't complete the coursework, so i won't get a job, won't get a house, be broke, no one will want to marry me, can't provide for family, friends hate me, etc, the list goes and on and on it goes. Then there's work. I can't get out of bed or bathe, so fuck it, I'll call in. Then I'll realize I should just quit because my brain says I'm useless. Hard to remain interested in a job or give a fuck or no get angry at the littlest things. then you start worrying about money without a job and then the wild thoughts run through your head like stated above. And then socially - I feel like laying in bed all day, in pjs, unshowered. I don't want to talk to anyone. I see people doing things, having fun, excelling at work, and it makes me feel bad about myself. I think I'm useless or boring or a pain for others, a burden, etc. This was based on depression, but there's also problems with anxiety and mania that are pretty much the same things.	well it affects every single aspect of my life it d take me a day to write it out and there are multiple people that have already written articles blogs on their own experiences what are the biggest things for me at the moment have been school i can t concentrate i don t care about getting good grades i don t go to class b c i can t get out of bed i feel sick when i get a bad grade or don t know something i feel alone in the classroom or i won t be able to complete a class so then i start thinking about my future and how i won t graduate because i can t complete the coursework so i won t get a job won t get a house be broke no one will want to marry me can t provide for family friends hate me etc the list goes and on and on it goes then there s work i can t get out of bed or bathe so fuck it i ll call in then i ll realize i should just quit because my brain says i m useless hard to remain interested in a job or give a fuck or no get angry at the littlest things then you start worrying about money without a job and then the wild thoughts run through your head like stated above and then socially i feel like laying in bed all day in pjs i don t want to talk to anyone i see people doing things having fun excelling at work and it makes me feel bad about myself i think i m useless or boring or a pain for others a burden etc this was based on depression but there s also problems with anxiety and mania that are pretty much the same things 	-0.1276	0.5395	314	1

People with terminal illnesses often can't feel better. Medicine can only do so much. Not to mention the medicine they give for pain often makes you very, very sick. Terminal patients are already very, very sick and this would make them feel worse. if you asked your small 8 year old cousin if they wanted to die while they were in the midst of some sort of extremely painful experience they have no way to make a reasoned decision. My hypothetical 8-year-old cousin isn't terminally ill and likely to die a slow and agonizing death within the next few months. That's the difference. The terminally ill *will* die and in extreme pain. You just want to draw it out and don't care that they're suffering needlessly because you think a miracle might occur. I don't understand how you don't see that I, as well as the Dutch Pediatric Association, understand that forcing a terminally ill child to continue an agonizing existence when they will certainly die soon anyway is cruel and inhumane. Even if you think a child cannot make a reasoned decision in this instance, the parents and the doctors can. As I said, what if someone made you continue to live in pain, not caring how much you're suffering, because they believed in the off chance a miracle could occur? That's what you want to do to these children. You're being flippant about their pain because you aren't the one suffering it.	people with terminal illnesses often can t feel better medicine can only do so much not to mention the medicine they give for pain often makes you very very sick terminal patients are already very very sick and this would make them feel worse if you asked your small year old cousin if they wanted to die while they were in the midst of some sort of extremely painful experience they have no way to make a reasoned decision my hypothetical year old cousin isn t terminally ill and likely to die a slow and agonizing death within the next few months that s the difference the terminally ill *will* die and in extreme pain you just want to draw it out and don t care that they re suffering needlessly because you think a miracle might occur i don t understand how you don t see that i as well as the dutch pediatric association understand that forcing a terminally ill child to continue an agonizing existence when they will certainly die soon anyway is cruel and inhumane even if you think a child cannot make a reasoned decision in this instance the parents and the doctors can as i said what if someone made you continue to live in pain not caring how much you re suffering because they believed in the off chance a miracle could occur ? that s what you want to do to these children you re being flippant about their pain because you aren t the one suffering it 	-0.2492	0.7021	256	1

New Player Wanting to Start in Ultima Online (probably UO Forever) Hi all. I was watching game-play footage and reading up on Albion Online, and seeing the game made me crave some similar sort of play - that is, some sort of pvp/crafting focused exploration open world fun. The closest game recommendation I could find in searches for similar, yet already released titles was UO. I've known about UO a long time, I've just never played it, as back in the day I wound up on EQ, and never tried UO. That being said, for all you UO fans out there, care to give me a brief run-down of the game? Some must-know tips for newbs maybe? Any in-game recommendations or hints? In the mean-time I've been reading up on wikis and websites, but I always enjoy talking to established fans and players. Thanks in advance for your replies :)	new player wanting to start in ultima online probably uo forever hi all i was watching game play footage and reading up on albion online and seeing the game made me crave some similar sort of play that is some sort of pvp crafting focused exploration open world fun the closest game recommendation i could find in searches for similar yet already released titles was uo i ve known about uo a long time i ve just never played it as back in the day i wound up on eq and never tried uo that being said for all you uo fans out there care to give me a brief run down of the game ? some must know tips for newbs maybe ? any in game recommendations or hints ? in the mean time i ve been reading up on wikis and websites but i always enjoy talking to established fans and players thanks in advance for your replies happy 	0.0205	0.3693	161	0

Well I am wondering what the second line therapy is then? I have taken all of the OTC options. I am on Cymbalta, which makes my pain worse but keeps me sane. Amitriptyline made me depressed.

These past 2 days I've been so close to just cheating because I'd probably just gain the 3lbs of water weight back. Last week I ate a little too much PB that took me to 35g of carbs, I was still registering as in ketosis, but I woke up the next morning to a 4 lb weight gain.

This is my handmade variable wattage OKR wooden box mod I made myself. It includes a master on/off switch, fire button, potentiometer, blue LED, and a 5/10 thread to mount any RDA. The internal components include a battery sled, 2 Sony VTC5s all copper wiring, zenor diode, an OKR 1/10 variable wattage chip, a few capacitors, and 4 rare earth magnets to hold on the lid. The wood is hand cut and worked using mahogany and I used guerrilla wood glue to attach the corners. From there I sanded it and stained it.Then did some wood burning As you can see its a bit haggard from lots of use. It isn't perfect but its something I made and have pride in and something no one else has. This is the first one I've built so the next one I build should be an improvement. Anyways I thought Id share.

"I had a panic attack in front of my boyfriend, and now I don't know how to face him. I usually never cry in front of other people, but these past few weeks I've had random crying phases that pop up several times a day, and they have been really confusing and frustrating. However, recently (and I think it's due to the meds I'm on) I had a really bad breakdown right in front of my boyfriend. I know I didn't make sense but I couldn't stop crying. At that moment in time I really wanted the whole world to just end. But what hurt me the most is that he started yelling at me too, and kept on saying ""I don't understand you"" and ""What do you want from me"" and ""I give up"". I was on the floor and he was all the way across the room. At that moment I wanted him to just be close to me and maybe let me know I wasn't completely alone. I realize now that this is just me wanting something and not considering what the other person is feeling, but now I don't know how to face him. One, because I am completely mortified by how much I cried and babbled. Two, because I can't help but feel hurt by how he got angry at me, even though on multiple occasions I have tried to tell him what is wrong with me, and what happens to me recently. He always avoids conversation about my depression, saying ""don't think about it, if you think about it, it won't go away"". I know it's probably annoying to hear someone talk about being depressed, but I thought he would at least try for me (we have been going out for some time). I don't know what to do, please help me out."	i had a panic attack in front of my boyfriend and now i don t know how to face him i usually never cry in front of other people but these past few weeks i ve had random crying phases that pop up several times a day and they have been really confusing and frustrating however recently and i think it s due to the meds i m on i had a really bad breakdown right in front of my boyfriend i know i didn t make sense but i couldn t stop crying at that moment in time i really wanted the whole world to just end but what hurt me the most is that he started yelling at me too and kept on saying i don t understand you and what do you want from me and i give up i was on the floor and he was all the way across the room at that moment i wanted him to just be close to me and maybe let me know i wasn t completely alone i realize now that this is just me wanting something and not considering what the other person is feeling but now i don t know how to face him one because i am completely mortified by how much i cried and two because i can t help but feel hurt by how he got angry at me even though on multiple occasions i have tried to tell him what is wrong with me and what happens to me recently he always avoids conversation about my depression saying don t think about it if you think about it it won t go away i know it s probably annoying to hear someone talk about being depressed but i thought he would at least try for me we have been going out for some time i don t know what to do please help me out 	-0.1302	0.6322	322	1

The Hampton Mansion, north of Baltimore, was the largest residence in America when finished in 1790. The empire-like holdings the Ridgley family had control over dipped heavily into early industries such as ironworks, mills, quarries, and armories which eventually supplied much of the cannon ordered by the Continental Congress for the revolution. I would say you are correct. The multiple large cities in the area greatly improved the market for inorganic materials and processing services which have a faster rate of return than farming. It would be interesting to see if there was a difference in marketing for the local tobacco versus the more southern tobacco. I think the southern product was exported overseas, while urban Marylanders would enjoy the bounty of their neighbors. Marketing overseas includes great risk and overhead, meanwhile the Ridgleys could sell to Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Wilmington, and settlers headed west.	the hampton mansion north of baltimore was the largest residence in america when finished in the empire like holdings the family had control over dipped heavily into early industries such as mills and which eventually supplied much of the cannon ordered by the continental congress for the revolution i would say you are correct the multiple large cities in the area greatly improved the market for inorganic materials and processing services which have a faster rate of return than farming it would be interesting to see if there was a difference in marketing for the local tobacco versus the more southern tobacco i think the southern product was exported overseas while urban marylanders would enjoy the bounty of their neighbors marketing overseas includes great risk and overhead meanwhile the could sell to philadelphia baltimore washington wilmington and settlers headed west 	0.221	0.203	140	0

[recording paused] [recording continued] MH: Weekly log for Subject 2907. Subject was uncooperative for most of her session today, but was able to continue after expressing concerns of what she could do to her loved ones. Before we were able to get anywhere, though, her session ended. She was about to be escorted back to her room when she became catatonic, a side effect of the treatments. I do not think she will last long in this facility with how quickly her mental state is deteriorating. We must get her back into the field as soon as possible if we are to reap the fruits of our work anytime soon. nbsp; [ERIFTESYDAER](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3dwcp3/satiation/)	ying thai kitchen queen anne ave n seattle wa wel to ying thai kitchen restaurant ! nbsp order table date server jack do not go home do not go to tacoma you are not safe call caleb he can help total item s sales tax grand total tip guide thank you very much come back again __ nbsp friday labs subject class fertile topic transcript of recording nbsp martin howard anyway i think we should pick up where we left off maybe sometime after you found the tape do you remember what happened next ? subject im not divulging anymore information until i can make a phone call martin howard say again ? subject im not telling you shit until i can call someone mh well you see you calling someone would defeat your purpose here what i cant get better unless im completely cut off from my loved ones ? mh its a complicated process look no one knows how my body responds better than i fucking do and if that date is correct sound of chair scraping back if that fucking calendar isnt a joke like everything else is in this goddamn place then my family hasnt heard from me in over two months and id like to not be a shitty daughter for once and let my fucking family know that im not dead ! mh name removed please calm down ill fucking calm down when i get a fucking phone call ! metal slamming into metal recording paused recording continued mh do you understand ? name removed do you understand ? i need you to respond muffled yes mh good im glad we were able to make that clear for you now lets begin again where ? mh whatever significant event happened after finding the vhs tape i went back to the forest mh which part ? where i found it by the removed mh did you find anything else ? no but then i entered the coordinates into my gps mh what coordinates ? the ones i found under the false bottom of the tin mh you didnt mention that earlier you said significant part next mh yes i did name removed i hope youre not lying to me or hiding anything from me what ? im not mh because if you were i get it alright ? im just trying to be as accurate as possible obviously my brain is a little fucked after everything that happened so i may forget tiny details here and there is that okay with you ? mh perhaps youre being too hostile today should we put you back in your room and leave you alone for another day ? no mh thats what i thought what did you find at the other coordinates ? door opening mh yes what do you want ? unidentified voice subject is to return to her room at this time mh well tell them were not finished yet unidentified voice sir by orders of lieutenant kernel harrison subject may only have forty five minutes of social interference a day i have been instructed to mh alright alright fine take her ill be speaking to harrison shortly well see you next week name removed unidentified voice is she not responding ? mh shit get the nurses tell them to bring removed now ! recording paused recording continued mh weekly log for subject subject was uncooperative for most of her session today but was able to continue after expressing concerns of what she could do to her loved ones before we were able to get anywhere though her session ended she was about to be escorted back to her room when she became catatonic a side effect of the treatments i do not think she will last long in this facility with how quickly her mental state is deteriorating we must get her back into the field as soon as possible if we are to reap the fruits of our work anytime soon nbsp 	0.0129	0.411	669	0

Ok let's see here. Ferguson is split into two sections S. Florissant which is mostly white and W. Florissant which is mostly black. It has been that way for yeeeeeeeeears. Well when everything happened W. Florissant came to S. Florissant blocking traffic and terrorizing those neighborhoods. In the past 10 years S. Florissant has rebuilt itself with a library, brewery, and what not. Where as W. Florissant has stayed a Section 8 ghetto pretty much. So in reality there are two separate Fergusons .	ok let s see here ferguson is split into two sections s florissant which is mostly white and w florissant which is mostly black it has been that way for years well when everything happened w florissant came to s florissant blocking traffic and terrorizing those neighborhoods in the past years s florissant has rebuilt itself with a library brewery and what not where as w florissant has stayed a section ghetto pretty much so in reality there are two separate fergusons 	0.0889	0.3595	82	0

"Did anyone else not notice how terrible their parents were until they moved away or grew up? Growing up, I always knew my mother was awful to me and my dad did some awful things too (although not nearly as bad as mom) but since the entire side of my mom's family is like that, I always saw it as normal. ""Yes, today my mom called me a worthless idiot, what's for dinner?"" Then just 2.5 years ago I met my boyfriend and we were sharing childhood stories. I remember my boyfriend looking shocked or offended at some of mine and finally one day he said, ""Your mother is awful and you should cut all contact with her."" Later I brought this up with my friends who I've known since middle school, and their replies were along the lines of, ""Yep, we can't stand your mom."" They just never mentioned it to me. I lived with it for 20-odd years, but it never occurred to me until it was pointed out. Anyway, I decided to make this post because I just found this subreddit and I already relate to so many of your stories. I'm sure I'll go into details at a later time, but right now I'm just reading other posts and coming to terms with the fact that I lived with emotional and psychological abuse for so long without realizing it. It's certainly had an affect on me. I've had severe depression since I was younger than 9 (9 is when I learned what suicide meant and could put a term to the feeling I'd had) and my anxiety can be pretty terrible too. I may have had those issues anyway, but my mother has made them 5 times worse at least."	did anyone else not notice how terrible their parents were until they moved away or grew up ? growing up i always knew my mother was awful to me and my dad did some awful things too although not nearly as bad as mom but since the entire side of my mom s family is like that i always saw it as normal yes today my mom called me a worthless idiot what s for dinner ? then just years ago i met my boyfriend and we were sharing childhood stories i remember my boyfriend looking shocked or offended at some of mine and finally one day he said your mother is awful and you should cut all contact with her later i brought this up with my friends who i ve known since middle school and their replies were along the lines of yep we can t stand your mom they just never mentioned it to me i lived with it for odd years but it never occurred to me until it was pointed out anyway i decided to make this post because i just found this subreddit and i already relate to so many of your stories i m sure i ll go into details at a later time but right now i m just reading other posts and coming to terms with the fact that i lived with emotional and psychological abuse for so long without realizing it it s certainly had an affect on me i ve had severe depression since i was younger than is when i learned what suicide meant and could put a term to the feeling i d had and my anxiety can be pretty terrible too i may have had those issues anyway but my mother has made them times worse at least 	-0.2194	0.4824	302	1

do you get depressed around your birthday? I always seem to get depressed around my birthday - even back when I was a kid. It's coming up at the end of the month and I'm already feeling down, starting to withdraw, and don't want to deal with people. Of course the more I isolate myself, the worse I feel. I wonder sometimes if this could be a conditioned response at this point (I'm in my early 30s). Or if somehow the time change and warmer weather could be involved? I so look forward to both of those, and yet find myself down when they arrive.

I just need to get this out and need some form of response. 25/f, in case it matters My anxiety used to be just very occasional, seemingly mild panic attacks. Then one day in late March, I took a nap after dinner and woke up to the most horrific panic attack of my life. It lasted 3 hours, then I finally went to the ER. They said I might be dehydrated, and then eventually discovered an ear infection. Apparently the nerve that goes from the inner ear to the brain, the one that causes dizziness with this, also goes to the part that triggers anxiety. So I had to deal with anxiety and dizziness for the next 10 days or so. I also started /r/keto around the time my dizziness subsided. Ever since mid-April I've had this constant mild anxiety, where my resting heart rate is 85-105 bpm. I have random dizzy spells. I've been off Zoloft for 7 months and ran out of lorazepam during my ear infection, and I can't get another script for a while due to a medical insurance snafu. My anxiety is in the form of hypochondria and doomsday thoughts. I can't drive on the freeway after work because I'm terrified of an accident. I'm constantly checking my pulse. I have anxiety when I wake up from naps, so I don't nap anymore. It seems that my depression is no longer wreaking havoc over my life, just the anxiety. It's driving me crazy. I've tried l-theanine, but I'm afraid to take it too much because of the hypochondria. I'm picking up magnesium on the way home from work for both anxiety and digestive issues. **Could this still be due to the inner ear problem? What should I do? Any luck with OTC supplements??**	i just need to get this out and need some form of response f in case it matters my anxiety used to be just very occasional seemingly mild panic attacks then one day in late march i took a nap after dinner and woke up to the most horrific panic attack of my life it lasted hours then i finally went to the er they said i might be dehydrated and then eventually discovered an ear infection apparently the nerve that goes from the inner ear to the brain the one that causes dizziness with this also goes to the part that triggers anxiety so i had to deal with anxiety and dizziness for the next days or so i also started r keto around the time my dizziness subsided ever since mid april i ve had this constant mild anxiety where my resting heart rate is bpm i have random dizzy spells i ve been off zoloft for months and ran out of lorazepam during my ear infection and i can t get another script for a while due to a medical insurance snafu my anxiety is in the form of hypochondria and doomsday thoughts i can t drive on the freeway after work because i m terrified of an accident i m constantly checking my pulse i have anxiety when i wake up from naps so i don t nap anymore it seems that my depression is no longer wreaking havoc over my life just the anxiety it s driving me crazy i ve tried l theanine but i m afraid to take it too much because of the hypochondria i m picking up magnesium on the way home from work for both anxiety and digestive issues could this still be due to the inner ear problem ? what should i do ? any luck with otc supplements ? ? 	-0.0917	0.5121	312	1

Not entirely correct. A parallel for self harm is (arguably) drug use. Some people do it to look cool/for attention and others do it because they do derive pleasure for it and it is a coping mechanism... I am probably wrong here (I don't have a source for you and I'm on my phone) but I remember reading somewhere that self harm releases endorphins into the body in response to the pain, and people can get addicted to that as well. There are also the psychological reasons behind it, such as feeling in control (when the self harmer feels that all other aspects of their life are out of their control, so they self harm because they can control the pain and it makes them feel empowered) And say what you want about attention seeking, but if someone is so desperate for attention that they feel the only way to get it is to deface their body, don't you think they need some help, regardless of the severity of their self harm?	not entirely correct a parallel for self harm is arguably drug use some people do it to look cool for attention and others do it because they do derive pleasure for it and it is a coping mechanism i am probably wrong here i don t have a source for you and i m on my phone but i remember reading somewhere that self harm releases endorphins into the body in response to the pain and people can get addicted to that as well there are also the psychological reasons behind it such as feeling in control when the self feels that all other aspects of their life are out of their control so they self harm because they can control the pain and it makes them feel empowered and say what you want about attention seeking but if someone is so desperate for attention that they feel the only way to get it is to deface their body don t you think they need some help regardless of the severity of their self harm ? 	-0.2025	0.4572	176	1

I need help choosing a beginner/intermediate lifting program So I've been lifting for about 3.5 months now and I'm at this kind of weird inbetween stage where I could really do either a beginner or intermediate workout. I'm looking for something that I can do 5-6 days per week. My primary goals are strength building, fat loss, and muscle growth. I'm so confused by the different workout plans and I have no idea how to decide.

But the foundational flaws in Sanders candidacy are pretty easy to spot. Sanders may be polling well in mostly white New Hampshire, but he hasnt been able to figure out how to earn more than 5 percent of the nonwhite vote, according to [national](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/06/01/2016.poll.pdf) [polls](http://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/06/02/National-Politics/Polling/question_15726.xml?uuid=jTWRTAkVEeWVHo4VCQ1krg). This is distressing and important. Sanders is the ideal candidate for a large chunk of minority voters. His political stance is more supportive of those on the lowest rung of the socioeconomic ladder (where many minorities are represented over-proportionally) than any other candidates. Especially hispanic and black voters, a large percentage of whom work blue-collar jobs (56.1% and 47.1% respectively, versus 36.8% of white workers^^[source](http://www.asanet.org/images/research/docs/pdf/RaceEthnicity_LaborMarket.pdf) ) Sanders should be able to get a large chunk of that vote, but right now his support in those communities is dismal. This brings me to a problem I see in this subreddit. Here the prevailing reaction to low support from minorities here seems to be one of frustration: Those voters should just be able to see how great Sanders would be for them, right? Of course, some of them will. With increased visibility, Sanders' numbers will increase in those demographics, but I doubt it will be a drastic change. For a drastic change, there must be drastic measures of outreach campaigning in the minority voter's communities. Because that's how politics work. People would rather vote for a visible/graspable candidate whose politics align imperfectly with their own than an unknown quantity who seems to be saying all the right things. Let's not forget that this subreddit is a huge echo chamber. It's mostly white, male, 18-25 year olds (well, it's reddit after all...) who have been hearing/reading/talking about Sanders for months now. Outside of this demographic, Bernie's still largely an unknown quantity. Mass rallies and media attention are slowly changing that fact, but without a *herculean targeted effort* of outreach towards minority voters, Bernie will be nothing but another crusty old white man to them when the primaries come. Why? I think one of the reasons is because those with the lowest socio-economic standing have the most cause to be cynical about politics. They're being courted in the election cycle, but as soon as the people they're voting for are in office, most of the promises give to them are then broken. You can't win a democratic nomination without the poor, but implementing the policies you promised them (e.g. get them through congress) is frustratingly hard. Poor people are being fucked every which way, it's easy to understand the cynicism and apathy towards the electoral process. What's to do about it? I don't have a quick-fix answer for that. All I can say is that the campaign hasn't yet focussed on the minority vote enough, and it's high time they start. Get Sander's message to black and hispanic neighbourhoods, to whatever group holds sway with minority voters, and do it quickly. Otherwise Hillary's gonna kick his ass up and down the states in the primaries. Because in you cannot win the democratic nomination without the minority vote. The good news is that Sander's message already appeals to the minority vote. Unlike other candidates, he does not have to to alter his message to cater to their interests, but he has to get it out there!	but the foundational flaws in sanders candidacy are pretty easy to spot sanders may be polling well in mostly white new hampshire but he hasnt been able to figure out how to earn more than percent of the vote according to national polls this is distressing and important sanders is the ideal candidate for a large chunk of minority voters his political stance is more supportive of those on the lowest rung of the socioeconomic ladder where many minorities are represented over proportionally than any other candidates especially hispanic and black voters a large percentage of whom work blue collar jobs and respectively versus of white workers source sanders should be able to get a large chunk of that vote but right now his support in those communities is dismal this brings me to a problem i see in this subreddit here the prevailing reaction to low support from minorities here seems to be one of frustration those voters should just be able to see how great sanders would be for them right ? of course some of them will with increased visibility sanders numbers will increase in those demographics but i doubt it will be a drastic change for a drastic change there must be drastic measures of outreach campaigning in the minority voter s communities because that s how politics work people would rather vote for a visible candidate whose politics align with their own than an unknown quantity who seems to be saying all the right things let s not forget that this subreddit is a huge echo chamber it s mostly white male year olds well it s reddit after all who have been hearing reading talking about sanders for months now outside of this demographic bernie s still largely an unknown quantity mass rallies and media attention are slowly changing that fact but without a targeted effort of outreach towards minority voters bernie will be nothing but another crusty old white man to them when the primaries come why ? i think one of the reasons is because those with the lowest socio economic standing have the most cause to be cynical about politics they re being courted in the election cycle but as soon as the people they re voting for are in office most of the promises give to them are then broken you can t win a democratic nomination without the poor but implementing the policies you promised them e g get them through congress is frustratingly hard poor people are being fucked every which way it s easy to understand the cynicism and apathy towards the electoral process what s to do about it ? i don t have a quick fix answer for that all i can say is that the campaign hasn t yet focussed on the minority vote enough and it s high time they start get sander s message to black and hispanic neighbourhoods to whatever group holds sway with minority voters and do it quickly otherwise hillary s gonna kick his ass up and down the states in the primaries because in you cannot win the democratic nomination without the minority vote the good news is that sander s message already appeals to the minority vote unlike other candidates he does not have to to alter his message to cater to their interests but he has to get it out there ! 	0.1688	0.2717	566	0

Those are pretty huge resume points. Obama and Clinton have no insights. They are merely politicians. That said, I totally hear you --- Democrats that don't speak the language of populism are missing the boat, and sadly, Al Gore's personality just doesn't work for a lot of people.

"Bernie Sanders most definitely knows that he will not Is there any useful information in that statement? Prediction markets currently give him 11%. The country is split basically 50/50 politically and the battle is for the increasingly small middle. ""The battle for the middle"" is a Sunday talk show trope, which like many things they say, is not backed by actual evidence. Elections are more likely won or lost based on the enthusiasm gap. Here's [an analysis from Nate Silver](http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/enthusiasm-gap-was-largest-in-presidential-swing-states/ ) which pretty convincingly demonstrates this. I.e., Battle for the Middle is nonsense. Voter enthusiasm is key. (Who has been drawing the largest crowds of any Presidential candidate?) If you are the kind of person who would vote for Bernie Sanders, you are not the kind of person who is going to vote for Bush, Paul, or Rubio. Not clear - Bernie appeals to voters who are frustrated by bad government. Republicans win low information voters with a populist message about big government elitists. Corporate Democrats play right into that messaging. Sanders' thesis is that there are a lot of people frustrated with government who would be open to a populist message from the left.

"The Crone also said she would kill Geralt, which she didn't. Crone's were wrong about a lot of things. I doubt they thought they would all be killed by Geralt/Ciri, or that Geralt would betray them and release the children (what I did). Also if you also look in the quest log for the final quest it say something to the effect of ""well as for Geralt, that's another story."". Dandelion also dosen't say anything about Yen,Triss, etc (at least in my ending), he only speaks of the political situation. I don't think that's really implying anything.

Anger is natural in some forms of depression, unfortunately. I call them 'rage-flashes' when they happen to me. Something sets me off, sometimes something as simple as an imagined sleight in my mind, and I just want to lash out. It's unfortunate when we do lash out, because then we end up hurting ourselves, or worse, the people who care about us. Sounds to me like you and your grandfather were close? Because it sounds to me like his passing had a dramatic effect on you - which death, especially the death of a family member, can and will effect you. Especially if that person is close. I recently lost my aunt to pancreatic cancer - about 3 months passed between her diagnosis and her death. It was quick, it was vicious - and it was painful. When I found out she passed, I cried. I cried hard. Her and I hadn't been that close in the past few years (mainly because of distance, living in a different state), but I remember going to her place a few times every summer when I was little. So, when she passed, all those good memories flooded my mind, and I fell apart. I got depressed. I spiraled out, and just got angry for a short time at the universe - because how could it be so cruel as to take her from my family so quickly, and with such little warning. It's painful, there's nothing you can do about it. But that pain reminds us that we're human. Being human makes us special - regardless of whatever you may think or hear - being human does make you special. And being special makes you worth it. You are. As for you happiness, when you're dealing with so much, it can be hard to find. But it can be found. Start taking steps to get help with your depression. See a doctor, talk to friends who you can trust to seriously listen, and if none of those really appeal, come back to /r/depression, and voice your thoughts and feelings. Because, again - you're worth it. You really, really, really are.	anger is natural in some forms of depression unfortunately i call them rage flashes when they happen to me something sets me off sometimes something as simple as an imagined sleight in my mind and i just want to lash out it s unfortunate when we do lash out because then we end up hurting ourselves or worse the people who care about us sounds to me like you and your grandfather were close ? because it sounds to me like his passing had a dramatic effect on you which death especially the death of a family member can and will effect you especially if that person is close i recently lost my aunt to pancreatic cancer about months passed between her diagnosis and her death it was quick it was vicious and it was painful when i found out she passed i cried i cried hard her and i hadn t been that close in the past few years mainly because of distance living in a different state but i remember going to her place a few times every summer when i was little so when she passed all those good memories flooded my mind and i fell apart i got depressed i spiraled out and just got angry for a short time at the universe because how could it be so cruel as to take her from my family so quickly and with such little warning it s painful there s nothing you can do about it but that pain reminds us that we re human being human makes us special regardless of whatever you may think or hear being human does make you special and being special makes you worth it you are as for you happiness when you re dealing with so much it can be hard to find but it can be found start taking steps to get help with your depression see a doctor talk to friends who you can trust to seriously listen and if none of those really appeal come back to r depression and voice your thoughts and feelings because again you re worth it you really really really are 	-0.0877	0.7164	359	1

Maybe not in all cases but in some. I'm gonna post a personal anecdote in response to this. To preface, I'm a pretty fucking ugly guy. I was going up to attend a friend's party on the train, and because I'm relatively small and nervous around other people, I chose a seat away from most people. A group of girls and one other guy hopped on and sat maybe four or five seats ahead of me. I didn't look at these people, I minded my own business. It was about half-way through the trip when I heard them discussing me, about how I was 'creepy' ( mind you, I hadn't looked at them at all)and about how they'd probably kill themselves if they woke up to a face like mine. They later stuck a note on the back of my bag as I left saying 'Fuck me, I'm desperate.' I guess the point of this post is, some women (and men) do label unattractive guys 'creepy', even if they have had not prior social contact with them. I should also note that I was dressed appropriately (no scorpion jacket or fedora, *lol people who wear fedoras are so retarded, amirite?*), and had just had a haircut that most would deem 'socially acceptable'. There was no reason beyond my face that these people would find me creepy. Edit: Shit at grammar. I'll never make it as a writer.	maybe not in all cases but in some i m gonna post a personal anecdote in response to this to preface i m a pretty fucking ugly guy i was going up to attend a friend s party on the train and because i m relatively small and nervous around other people i chose a seat away from most people a group of girls and one other guy hopped on and sat maybe four or five seats ahead of me i didn t look at these people i minded my own business it was about half way through the trip when i heard them discussing me about how i was creepy mind you i hadn t looked at them at all and about how they d probably kill themselves if they woke up to a face like mine they later stuck a note on the back of my bag as i left saying fuck me i m desperate i guess the point of this post is some women and men do label unattractive guys creepy even if they have had not prior social contact with them i should also note that i was dressed appropriately no scorpion jacket or fedora lol people who wear fedoras are so retarded amirite ? wink and had just had a haircut that most would deem socially acceptable there was no reason beyond my face that these people would find me creepy edit shit at grammar i ll never make it as a writer 	-0.0793	0.585	249	1

Typical day starts around 7am. Breakfast. One hour of either TV or video games. (assuming not a schoolday). One to two hours of self-play, generally in their rooms, sometimes outside. Together time until lunch. Lunch. Open afternoons, depends on what has to happen that day, sometimes errands, sometimes recreations, sometimes crafts. Dinner preparation is family time, dinner is family time. After dinner routine that leads to bedtime. Good is being a dad, stressful is getting young kids to do stuff together is like trying to herd cats. 5. Struggling to make every day relevant, and stay involvled with the kids. I'm tired all the time, and work too much, so is tough to stay involved instead of just sleeping all day. 6. I don't really ever feel defeated as a parent. I generally feel that I'm doing a better job than most dads in similar situations. 7. Not really reliant on goods or services when it comes to the kids, but in the spirit of the question, would have to say either Netflix/Internet, or the Wii. They both allow the kids some time doing something that I only have to half supervise, allowing me time to do some grown-up things.	full time manager m step son part time contact m at home f at home job doesnt give me traditional weekday weekend but i have five work days two off so typical day starts around breakfast one hour of either tv or video games assuming not a one to two hours of self play generally in their rooms sometimes outside together time until lunch lunch open afternoons depends on what has to happen that day sometimes errands sometimes sometimes crafts dinner preparation is family time dinner is family time after dinner routine that leads to bedtime good is being a dad stressful is getting young kids to do stuff together is like trying to herd cats struggling to make every day relevant and stay with the kids i m tired all the time and work too much so is tough to stay involved instead of just sleeping all day i don t really ever feel defeated as a parent i generally feel that i m doing a better job than most dads in similar situations not really reliant on goods or services when it comes to the kids but in the spirit of the question would have to say either netflix internet or the wii they both allow the kids some time doing something that i only have to half supervise allowing me time to do some grown up things 	0.0857	0.481	230	0

"There is this movie from Quebec, quite a classic, that is titled ""Aurore"". It is based on the true story of a little girl named Aurore who lived in the early 20th century, I believe. She was recklessly abused by her father and step-mom, who eventually killed her (indirectly, she died as a result of her injuries). No one in the village believed her, despite her obvious injuries. After her death though, everyone felt terrible. The priest felt so guilty for not helping sooner, he ended up committing suicide. It is truly a sad film. The original version is apparently worst, but in the newer version, the abuse and her death are still enough to make you sick.

My 18-year-old cat was put down. I am feeling guilt for not holding her during. She had cancer for a little while, but blood in her urine told us it spread to her bladder, so we decided it was time to put her down. So I was there in the office with her, crying my eyes out. The vet said I could hold her, or just put her on the table and pet her. I felt absolute dread at the thought of her going limp in my arms. I was barely holding up as was and I was afraid that would make me lose it. It was taking all my strength to be there at all. My sister had offered to take her in so I wouldn't have to, but I was determined to be there in her last moments. So I rubbed her back as she was euthanized. Now I am extremely sorry I didn't hold her. I know she didn't know she was about to die. She only knew she was in a place where she had been before and I was petting her.

"Okay, but that's most American wars since WWII, Most?! Other than Korea (which we refuse to officially end) and the 1991 Gulf War which both had UN authorizations, I don't recall *any* US wars where we were attacked by another country since that time. Thus, except for those two exceptions, they're *all* wars of aggression. That's the job of our military -- to attack other countries and subjugate them to our empire, and to seize markets and complete corporate conquests. And that's been the US military's job for a long, long time. Trump is still a giant... You'll have no argument from me there. He's literally a [demagogue](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/demagogue).

I honestly believe the worst part of having an infant would be the SIDS worry. SIDS - sudden infant death syndrome - is what they call it when an infant dies and there is no explanation. It's probably caused by babies falling into a deep sleep and not breathing. Despite many ways to lower the risk, thousands of babies still die from it every year in the USA alone. What kind of shit is this?! Knowing me, if I had an infant I would be driven literally insane from the worry.

Combine that with austerity measures, government officials make less, thus increasing corruption, and reducing tax revenue.	its more than that greece has a very corrupt system when it comes to paying taxes like if i made k euro i could pay he tax man x euro to say my income was k this corruption was systemic it wasn t a lack of work it was a lack of responsibility combine that with austerity measures government officials make less thus increasing corruption and reducing tax revenue 	-0.1056	0.128	69	1

I agree completely. He did wrong things for reasons that he believed to be right. I mean, there are a lot of characters like that, but after reading his background history I could understand why he was so ruthless, albeit unable to condone. Also I loved how he was pretty much the only one who could threaten Joff. And then of course, the Charles Dance factor.

"I've listened to their show from time to time, and am waiting for my laundry to dry, so here's my ""one big thing"" collection of random thoughts. SVP always seemed like the princess and the pea. Too fussy and full of himself. Rusillo usually has more interesting takes, but seems to suffer from a pseudo-arrogant ""I went to the wrong fraternity and didn't get with enough girls back then and am getting older and all my friends are married to hotties and I'm not sure if people tune in to listen to just SVP and just tolerate me"" mentality. But, besides all of that, they are the best ESPN radio show by a sizable degree. SVP's late night show may work. Matters how curmudgeony he is. If he just has fun with it and carves a new niche where he's not a fuss-pot, then it may have legs. He doesn't have even half of Letterman's charisma, wit, intelligence, and knowledge base, so I think just being the ""tall cynical guy who knows Tiger Woods"" won't be enough. Rusillo on the other hand, who knows. I assume he doesn't want to just chill in that time slot with that Virk guy or whomever. Virk still needs to apologize for littering throughout the U.S. He talked about it on the show for awhile and seemed to imply zero regret while laughing about it. He's low-end talent that needs to bake awhile longer in the basement of ESPN News for awhile until he actually can play with the big boys and girls. Speaking of girls, I would love to see more female hosts and anchors. Jackie MacMullan is one of my favorite ESPN personalities, though she's not on Around the Horn enough. She guest hosted His and Hers recently. I wish she was a daily, permanent presence on ESPN. Back to Rusillo. He may bolt and join Bill Simmons, doing whatever he's doing next, but I think money may keep him with ESPN as an NBA analyst/radio host/etc. Also that guy who doesn't believe in dinosaurs seems like a bully.

"[TOMT][Short anime story] Two panda(or other bear) cubs are journeying somewhere, they start fighting and somehow end up lost because of it This just came to me last night. When I was little I had a VHS tape and it had some short animated kids stories on it. I can't remember if there was any rhyme or reason as to the things on it, maybe it was things we'd recorded off tv, but one of the stories was about a couple of panda cubs. It may have been in anime or Western style, I'm unsure, but basically the two panda cubs (possibly some other type of bear cub) are travelling some where together. Starts off with one of them saying they were bored, which I remember because I had to ask my Mum what 'bored' meant. Eventually they start squabbling and, I don't know, smash the world or cause some sort of rift (possibly something to do with that part of the world being made of crystals)? At any rate, it ends with them being separated, either from each other or with no hope of ever getting home again. Something depressing like that. The moral of course was ""don't fight or quarrel"". Anybody? I feel like I would definitely recognise the voice acting if I heard it (American accents). Please help me recover this bit of my childhood :p"	tomt short anime story two panda or other bear cubs are somewhere they start fighting and somehow end up lost because of it this just came to me last night when i was little i had a vhs tape and it had some short animated kids stories on it i can t remember if there was any rhyme or reason as to the things on it maybe it was things we d recorded off tv but one of the stories was about a couple of panda cubs it may have been in anime or western style i m unsure but basically the two panda cubs possibly some other type of bear cub are travelling some where together starts off with one of them saying they were bored which i remember because i had to ask my mum what bored meant eventually they start squabbling and i don t know smash the world or cause some sort of rift possibly something to do with that part of the world being made of crystals ? at any rate it ends with them being separated either from each other or with no hope of ever getting home again something depressing like that the moral of course was don t fight or quarrel anybody ? i feel like i would definitely recognise the voice acting if i heard it american accents please help me recover this bit of my childhood tong 	-0.0831	0.7655	237	1

It's a real bummer, man. But think of it this way - you see now that she is shallow, and not compassionate. However, assume that she had the feelings she posted on her twitter, but instead she didn't express them. You two go on a date, she is there, but mentally still feels that. You become a couple, are together for a while, but still she has that disinterest, and at this point is wildly afraid to express it in fear of damaging you, so she cheats, and you find out, and it's 5x ad heartbreaking as that Twitter post. When a girl turns me down, it's a bummer, but it's a relief because I know that I don't have to be ultimately let down later on.	it s a real bummer man but think of it this way you see now that she is shallow and not compassionate however assume that she had the feelings she posted on her twitter but instead she didn t express them you two go on a date she is there but mentally still feels that you become a couple are together for a while but still she has that disinterest and at this point is wildly afraid to express it in fear of damaging you so she cheats and you find out and it s x ad heartbreaking as that twitter post when a girl turns me down it s a bummer but it s a relief because i know that i don t have to be ultimately let down later on 	-0.1431	0.4818	132	1
"Sorry for cutting in - if you get the time please check my responses below. I'm in Mumbai, India. I have a similar problem getting my psychotropic meds for depression/anxiety. I have to go get them every month and it's quite traumatic because of the sheer anxiety of the pharmacists judging me. If I understand correctly, in the US, pharmacies get prescriptions directly from shrinks (at least that's what my friend in NYC told me), and you just have to walk up there and get your meds. Here, I have to get a physical prescription, go on the same date, and then stand for about 20 minutes to eventually get my meds. Plus, sometimes, they say ""not in stock,"" which means I'll have to call them and/or visit them multiple times.

I feel so defeated. For the past few months my pain has been getting worse, in the past month it became unbearable and I had to take time off work. I have been trying to figure out how to get help. Last Sunday I went to the ER because the pain in my hips and jaw was so bad. They gave me norco for it and they knew I had an appointment set up to take care of it. Today I finally had an appointment with a pain specialist and he basically told me that I am too far fucked up for him to even know where to begin treating me. He didn't even know people with my condition could have it in their entire body. And he told me he cant help me with the meds because he doesn't know how he is going to fix me. I feel shattered. The hope of not being in horrible pain 24/7 is now gone. I have no idea how I am supposed to get though this. He gave be a referral to a rheumatologist so I will pursue that. I just dont want to get my hopes up. Edit: I called the rheumatologist to make an appointment and the lady checked with him and apparently he said that he doesn't treat my condition and that I should see a pain specialist. Fucking seriously? On the bright side I called my GP and told her everything that happened and that I just dont know what to do and she prescribed me some more of the pain pills I got from the ER. So at least theres that. They dont help as much as I would like but its a lot better than nothing.	i feel so defeated for the past few months my pain has been getting worse in the past month it became unbearable and i had to take time off work i have been trying to figure out how to get help last sunday i went to the er because the pain in my hips and jaw was so bad they gave me norco for it and they knew i had an appointment set up to take care of it today i finally had an appointment with a pain specialist and he basically told me that i am too far fucked up for him to even know where to begin treating me he didn t even know people with my condition could have it in their entire body and he told me he cant help me with the meds because he doesn t know how he is going to fix me i feel shattered the hope of not being in horrible pain is now gone i have no idea how i am supposed to get though this he gave be a referral to a rheumatologist so i will pursue that i just dont want to get my hopes up edit i called the rheumatologist to make an appointment and the lady checked with him and apparently he said that he doesn t treat my condition and that i should see a pain specialist fucking seriously ? on the bright side i called my gp and told her everything that happened and that i just dont know what to do and she prescribed me some more of the pain pills i got from the er so at least theres that they dont help as much as i would like but its a lot better than nothing 	-0.1102	0.6098	294	1

So by that I'll lose my unlimited data and end up paying the same amount of money for less data.

At that MMR, any hero can destroy if you're more skilled than your opponents. The issue isn't the hero you're picking, the issue is that you aren't better than them. The easiest way to win, regardless of hero, is to outfarm them.

3 years clean: worse off than ever before Title says it all. No harm in 3 years aside from punching the occasional wall, but compared to the hundreds of previous cuts I'll call that good. Even got better without the family ever knowing it was a problem. But I'm worse than ever before. Went off to grad school. In less than a year it sucked all the life from me. The hidden self hatred is like an exposed nerve without anything pleasurable to cover it up. Between my awful grades, disappointed professor, lack of any friends in a 75 mile radius, and lack of any romantic connections I'm losing my mind. I'm slowly driving my only true friend away via text because there's only so long s person can put up with this shit. Tonight I snapped a door off my kitchen cabinet and shattered my mirror. I'm not angry at anyone but myself. I'm constantly angry at myself, screaming at me when no one else is around because just... Everything. I want to cut so badly but knowing I can't let myself just makes it even worse, like a firework in a tin can. I'm trying to hold on but damn... It's like my own mind is consciously trying to kill me and that's what drives me mad. It's conscious decisions, not blind impulse. Conscious decisions I know I'll regret but feel compelled to do anyway.	years clean worse off than ever before title says it all no harm in years aside from punching the occasional wall but compared to the hundreds of previous cuts i ll call that good even got better without the family ever knowing it was a problem but i m worse than ever before went off to grad school in less than a year it sucked all the life from me the hidden self hatred is like an exposed nerve without anything pleasurable to cover it up between my awful grades disappointed professor lack of any friends in a mile radius and lack of any romantic connections i m losing my mind i m slowly driving my only true friend away via text because there s only so long s person can put up with this shit tonight i snapped a door off my kitchen cabinet and shattered my mirror i m not angry at anyone but myself i m constantly angry at myself screaming at me when no one else is around because just everything i want to cut so badly but knowing i can t let myself just makes it even worse like a firework in a tin can i m trying to hold on but damn it s like my own mind is consciously trying to kill me and that s what drives me mad it s conscious decisions not blind impulse conscious decisions i know i ll regret but feel compelled to do anyway 	-0.0896	0.5628	247	1
Sure, they may save lives, but is that necessarily a good thing? More lives saved by self driving cars means more people around to pollute and use resources.

I've spent so long trying to figure out what caused it, maybe I'm tired? Maybe it's PMT? Maybe it's my job maybe I hate it? Maybe it's my boyfriend? Maybe it's my friend group? So I've spent years 'hitting the refresh button' on my life, shaking things up and although some choices turned out to be good choices a lot of them were bad. Because I would do them but still feel awful or even worse. And I'd ask myself 'what's wrong with me why aren't I coping like other people, why am I not happy?' That's what made it all so much worse, then I'd repress emotions because I thought they weren't normal but they are. Being a part of this horrible yet supportive sub reddit should help you see that. Yes we don't work like others do, yes we deal with things differently, we aren't broken or strange. I had a kidney infection last year, I left it and it got worse and I couldn't drink for six months, that was strange and it meant i was different to other people, i couldn't get drunk and have fun like they did (like now i'm depressed, i don't feel the fun that they seem to be having), but i got help and i got better and it meant i could drink and i could have fun again. Our illness is just like that but it's not visible to others, we aren't showing physical pain, it just means that we're working differently to they are because we are ill, i used to spent weeks even months feeling suicidal, now i have minutes, hours at most, because i've sought help (like i did with my kidney) and i'm getting better, which means i'll be able to deal with things better, like others. We all work differently, every one of us, so we aren't broken just because we're working differently to others. People were there for me and looked after me when i was ill with my kidney because it was visible, i kept my depression from people and shut them out because i thought i was strange and broken, now i'm learning to let people in and feel the emotions and it's so much better, i talk to people and they understand better so they can help better in the future, instead of me just being angry or seeming moody, meaning they got fed up or angry they can now sympathise. Anyway the point to all of this was, sometimes there isn't a reason, maybe there used to be and maybe there is one big thing that's caused your depression and makes it worse, but like my kidney once it was bad it was bad, and when it got worse sometimes it meant it was just taking longer to get better, do you see that depression is like that? we left it a bit too late because we didn't understand what was wrong, so we got a little worse. Which meant we were already there, already ill. So now, when we have down days it doesn't mean that something has caused it, if you go on trying to find something, anything, when you don't feel better you will end up hating yourself, being angry at yourself. If you just let yourself feel everything you feel, no explanations as to why you're feeling it (unless you can pinpoint it for definite) then when you have those moments of clearness, clarity and those little moments of feeling happy, you'll be at a better place to try and work out if anything was wrong, because you'll see it clearer.

God I hate this thought process. Ionic taught them these vulnerabilities in a class that they PAID FOR. They had every right to use them, just like someone has the right to use code they wrote in a programming class. They do not need to ask him for permission, and it sucks that they felt so bullied/intimidated by him that they used another, separate vulnerability that could have potentially been used for ios 8.	god i hate this thought process ionic taught them these vulnerabilities in a class that they paid for they had every right to use them just like someone has the right to use code they wrote in a programming class they do not need to ask him for permission and it sucks that they felt so bullied intimidated by him that they used another separate vulnerability that could have potentially been used for ios 	-0.1057	0.5	74	1

If I had a piece of rubbish after leaving the office I would have to wait until I got home around 1.5 hours later to dispose of it. No bins at my city stop, 1 hour train ride, no bins at destination stop, 10 min wait for the bus, 15 min ride home, 5 min walk from bus stop. Yeah, so I'm going to leave it at the station. Because at least cleaners will usually come along and pick it up there as opposed to throwing it on the street. I suppose that makes me irresponsible but it's the truth and why my station was always littered with people's rubbish.	if i had a piece of rubbish after leaving the office i would have to wait until i got home around hours later to dispose of it no bins at my city stop hour train ride no bins at destination stop min wait for the bus min ride home min walk from bus stop yeah so i m going to leave it at the station because at least cleaners will usually come along and pick it up there as opposed to throwing it on the street i suppose that makes me irresponsible but it s the truth and why my station was always littered with people s rubbish 	-0.1833	0.2547	108	1

Worried student here, what exactly are my career options? Hello everyone! I'm currently a student studying Geomatics Engineering (accredited) with geology and CS on the side as minors and am worried about my career options. Most posts i've read here say that GIS is mainly a desk job, no field work, etc. and quite a few posts expressed disdain in their jobs. While I still enjoy doing GIS related projects in class, if all else fails, do I have any other options? Just for clarification, some things covered in education include: - Engineering Computation (Basically programming with Matlab) - Engineering math, calculus I,II,III, linear algebra - Engineering risk analysis - Database Systems (Programming with SQL) - Python, C++ and Java - GIS, GIS and more GIS - Some remote sensing - A handful of geology courses I apologise for any inconvenience I may cause but thank you in advance for offering your insight!	worried student here what exactly are my career options ? hello everyone ! i m currently a student studying geomatics engineering accredited with geology and cs on the side as minors and am worried about my career options most posts i ve read here say that gis is mainly a desk job no field work etc and quite a few posts expressed disdain in their jobs while i still enjoy doing gis related projects in class if all else fails do i have any other options ? just for clarification some things covered in education include engineering computation basically programming with matlab engineering math calculus i ii i linear algebra engineering risk analysis database systems programming with sql python c and java gis gis and more gis some remote sensing a handful of geology courses i apologise for any inconvenience i may cause but thank you in advance for offering your insight ! 	0.0845	0.621	153	0

My ex was horrible about understanding my anxiety. We would be in public and I would start getting extremely anxious, so I would say I think I need to leave. He would be confused, say that I didn't look anxious, and proceed to continue doing whatever we were doing in public (shopping or whatever). Then I would say, I need to leave, I'm leaving, and he would get all butthurt and claim I used my anxiety as an excuse to not spend time with him. Sigh. Hence the ex part.	my ex was horrible about understanding my anxiety we would be in public and i would start getting extremely anxious so i would say i think i need to leave he would be confused say that i didn t look anxious and proceed to continue doing whatever we were doing in public shopping or whatever then i would say i need to leave i m leaving and he would get all butthurt and claim i used my anxiety as an excuse to not spend time with him sigh hence the ex part 	-0.2786	0.3873	92	1

Isn't Aquaman in it too? Whoop! I understand what you mean about Superman and his motives. But to me it looks like it really will be Batman attacking and Superman defending. Then, when humanity turns on him, he might just take it all out on Batman, who is kinda provoking him, and kick his ass. I never really had a fault with Man of Steel. The whole reason to side against Zod was so as not to doom an entire race. That makes sense. So now that he's saved Earth, the humans turn on him, and Batman is at the forefront of that.

The internal components include a battery sled, 2 Sony VTC5s all copper wiring, zenor diode, an OKR 1/10 variable wattage chip, a few capacitors, and 4 rare earth magnets to hold on the lid. The wood is hand cut and worked using mahogany and I used guerrilla wood glue to attach the corners. From there I sanded it and stained it.Then did some wood burning As you can see its a bit haggard from lots of use.

The Briar Patch From [this prompt](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/29vmoz/ip_the_briar_patch/) [The Briar Patch](http://www.kimsokol.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AliceRevised.jpg) by [Kim Sokol](http://kimsokol.tumblr.com/) --- Laney had hoped that she was finished crying. Past all that. *You're a grown-up now,* her mother had told her. That was a full year ago, but this night, for the first time, she might have felt like one. Laney studied her appearance in the full-length mirror once again. Her mother's gardening cloak hung around her shoulders, still a bit too large. Its silvery seams glimmered with enchantments, the pinnacles of the stitching ended elegantly in rosebuds. Another rose, this one black, adorned the band in her stark white hair. She looked ready for anything. Almost. She skipped back to fetch a sword from the bed. With its belt slung over her shoulder, the jade scabbard dragged and rattled on the rough-hewn wooden floor. --- Standing at the gate, Laney traced the intricate patterns of the wrought-iron with a finger. She'd walked by a thousand times before, never paying any mind to them. Roses, for their beauty. And thorns to keep children out of the cemetery beyond. Laney wasn't a child any longer. There was no lock to be seen, but she felt something in her chest tugging her forward. She touched the delicate, silver-inlaid hilt to the center of the gate, and the black vines around it came to life, spiraling outward from the center. The silver in her sword and robe began to glow, the ancient magic of the strange town yawning to life. Inside the gates, soft sounds could be heard in the darkness. Dragging. The smell of fresh, wet dirt, and another - deeper and muskier - of decay. Laney lowered herself to one knee to light a lamp from her pack. Focusing on the wick, she didn't see the dark shapes moving in the soft light of the match. She held the lamp high. Higher, higher. It was plucked from her gloved hand. All around her, green stalks twisted and writhed around her, their thorns just grazing her robe. The silver glowed brightly in resistance. Her lips pressed into a thin smile. She gripped the glowing hilt tightly in her left hand, and pulled the green steel blade clear of its scabbard. The roses around her hissed their distaste like great serpents. With dexterous grace, she mowed them down as fast as they came.	the patch from this prompt the patch by kim sokol laney had hoped that she was finished crying past all that you re a grown up now her mother had told her that was a full year ago but this night for the first time she might have felt like one laney studied her appearance in the full length mirror once again her mother s gardening cloak hung around her shoulders still a bit too large its silvery seams with enchantments the pinnacles of the stitching ended elegantly in another rose this one black adorned the band in her stark white hair she looked ready for anything almost she skipped back to fetch a sword from the bed with its belt slung over her shoulder the jade dragged and rattled on the rough wooden floor standing at the gate laney traced the intricate patterns of the wrought iron with a finger she d walked by a thousand times before never paying any mind to them roses for their beauty and thorns to keep children out of the cemetery beyond laney wasn t a child any longer there was no lock to be seen but she felt something in her chest tugging her forward she touched the delicate silver hilt to the center of the gate and the black vines around it came to life spiraling outward from the center the silver in her sword and robe began to glow the ancient magic of the strange town yawning to life inside the gates soft sounds could be heard in the darkness dragging the smell of fresh wet dirt and another deeper and of decay laney lowered herself to one knee to light a lamp from her pack focusing on the wick she didn t see the dark shapes moving in the soft light of the match she held the lamp high higher higher it was plucked from her gloved hand all around her green stalks twisted and writhed around her their thorns just grazing her robe the silver glowed brightly in resistance her lips pressed into a thin smile she gripped the glowing hilt tightly in her left hand and pulled the green steel blade clear of its the roses around her hissed their distaste like great serpents with grace she mowed them down as fast as they came 	0.0783	0.3526	388	0
I became insecure and low in confidence. It felt as if any decision I made was the wrong choice. Whether it was over something trivial or big. Even as an adult, I'm hesitant about making big decisions, I'm 24 now and about to sign contracts for a mortgage. Other relatives have told me that he's been telling everyone that I won't be able to 'cope' with it. My Father is very lazy and hasn't achieved much in life. The house that he, my Mother and youngest brother live in is owned by my maternal grandmother.. He's also not working due to 'health problems'. So I think that maybe he's a little envious and that's why he's always putting me down now that he can't control my actions. It's very frustrating as a child because all children want to do is make their parents proud. I was so eager to please and yet every decision I made for myself was the wrong one. Even for work placement week at school, I 'apparently' chose the wrong thing and he guilt tripped me in to doing an activity that I didn't want to do, oh and I struggled like hell with it. So thanx Dad lol. Don't get me wrong I know my Father isn't the worst Father out there but he certainly isn't up for Dad of the year award.	i became insecure and low in confidence it felt as if any decision i made was the wrong choice whether it was over something trivial or big even as an adult i m hesitant about making big decisions i m now and about to sign contracts for a mortgage other relatives have told me that he s been telling everyone that i won t be able to cope with it my father is very lazy and hasn t achieved much in life the house that he my mother and youngest brother live in is owned by my maternal grandmother he s also not working due to health problems so i think that maybe he s a little envious and that s why he s always putting me down now that he can t control my actions it s very frustrating as a child because all children want to do is make their parents proud i was so eager to please and yet every decision i made for myself was the wrong one even for work placement week at school i apparently chose the wrong thing and he guilt tripped me in to doing an activity that i didn t want to do oh and i struggled like hell with it so thanx dad lol don t get me wrong i know my father isn t the worst father out there but he certainly isn t up for dad of the year award 	-0.0929	0.4512	242	1

"This was all shot with the camera on auto, it's tough to work out exposure etc using a small phone display outdoors. Immediate things I noticed: DJI Pilot automatically saves the video to your phone/tablet, which absolutely destroys the battery. My Note 4 died before I got the third battery into the Phantom. The ultrasonic sensor/visual positioning thing screws with your shots if you're trying to fly smoothly, best to turn it off or fly in attitude if you're looking for stable footage. A fair bit of chromatic aberration in the final image, and it really doesn't like being pointed into the sun. I was happy to discover after my phone ran out that it'll fly without the phone connected, and because there's a record button on the controller, you can still film even if you can't see - the last 5 or 6 clips were done blind. Oh, and it hates taking off on a slanted surface. Out in the bush I couldn't find a totally flat spot for liftoff, and the little ""whoosh whoosh"" warmup routine it does when you start the props ended up tipping it over. Grrrrr. Anyway hope that's helpful to somebody!"	this was all shot with the camera on auto it s tough to work out exposure etc using a small phone display outdoors immediate things i noticed dji pilot automatically saves the video to your phone tablet which absolutely destroys the battery my note died before i got the third battery into the phantom the ultrasonic sensor visual positioning thing screws with your shots if you re trying to fly smoothly best to turn it off or fly in attitude if you re looking for stable footage a fair bit of aberration in the final image and it really doesn t like being pointed into the sun i was happy to discover after my phone ran out that it ll fly without the phone connected and because there s a record button on the controller you can still film even if you can t see the last or clips were done blind oh and it hates taking off on a slanted surface out in the bush i couldn t find a totally flat spot for liftoff and the little whoosh whoosh warmup routine it does when you start the props ended up tipping it over gr anyway hope that s helpful to somebody ! 	0.2439	0.555	204	0

Amino acids on their own don't significantly affect mRNA expression of satiety-related genes, no. But the processing of various nutrients by the digestive system is very complicated, and foods that contain proteins can sometimes affect one's ability to resist hunger and cravings due to various factors in my opinion. But since a BCAA drink is just that, BCAAs, it should not affect satiety like, say, meat products would.	amino acids on their own don t significantly affect mrna expression of satiety related genes no but the processing of various nutrients by the digestive system is very complicated and foods that contain proteins can sometimes affect one s ability to resist hunger and cravings due to various factors in my opinion but since a bcaa drink is just that bcaas it should not affect satiety like say meat products would 	0.0333	0.0	71	0

AM: Rinse face, Stridex pad, 2.5% BP on acne (all on chin and neck), apply Neutrogena sunscreen, then makeup. PM: Remove makeup with mineral oil, Cerave foaming cleanser, Alpha Hydrox, wait 30 minutes, 2.5% BP on acne, wait about 10 minutes, then Cerave in the tub. I have been doing this routine for about 2 weeks, was doing the same routine minus the Alpha Hydrox for about a month and a half. I did include one product at a time. My issue is I have this breakout on my neck. I have never, ever in my entire life had a breakout on my neck. It's really nasty and all concentrated in one area, only on the left side of my neck. Oddly, I only ever seem to get acne on the left side of my face. Around my lip, and chin, and now neck, but on the left side only. What's the deal? I'm super frustrated about this breakout because wth, neck acne was never a problem. It's itchy and red, and some of the pimples are white. I stopped wearing makeup as of yesterday. The only thing I am thinking is the Alpha Hydrox, because I do tend to bring it down on my neck if I've put too much on. Would this cause acne to come out on my neck? I'm just frustrated because even when I was sleeping in my makeup and not ever washing my face I had zero issues with neck acne. Any help is super appreciated.	am rinse face stridex pad bp on acne all on chin and neck apply neutrogena sunscreen then makeup pm remove makeup with mineral oil cerave foaming cleanser alpha hydrox wait minutes bp on acne wait about minutes then cerave in the tub i have been doing this routine for about weeks was doing the same routine minus the alpha hydrox for about a month and a half i did include one product at a time my issue is i have this breakout on my neck i have never ever in my entire life had a breakout on my neck it s really nasty and all concentrated in one area only on the left side of my neck oddly i only ever seem to get acne on the left side of my face around my lip and chin and now neck but on the left side only what s the deal ? i m super frustrated about this breakout because wth neck acne was never a problem it s itchy and red and some of the pimples are white i stopped wearing makeup as of yesterday the only thing i am thinking is the alpha hydrox because i do tend to bring it down on my neck if i ve put too much on would this cause acne to come out on my neck ? i m just frustrated because even when i was sleeping in my makeup and not ever washing my face i had zero issues with neck acne any help is super appreciated 	-0.0836	0.371	255	1

"""The FBI has been telling us only pedophiles use encryption, so of course we didn't use it..."" Mike Rogers, the former chairman of the House intelligence committee, said last week that Chinese intelligence agencies have for some time been seeking to assemble a database of information about Americans. Those personal details can be **used for blackmail**, or also to shape bogus emails designed to appear legitimate while **injecting spyware** on the networks of government agencies or businesses Chinese hackers are trying to penetrate. Interesting that he believes all of that. I don't recall him advocating against NSA gathering all of the same information about Americans because of those same reasons.

"Ah yes, please tell me how the severe allergy I've had since childhood really works. I am perfectly aware that the lanolin is what actually causes the allergic reaction and not the hair itself. I know this because when I was in elementary school I wore a wool jacket and did not get a ""rash"" but rather a very bad case of hives - it was so bad my parents were worried that I might have shingles. My skin became red and blotchy from head to toe, and it was so itchy and miserable I could barely move. I had to go to the doctor and get prescription allergy medications to combat the reaction and the rash still didn't completely go away for almost an entire week. Since then I have done a lot of research about what causes allergies like mine, what fibers are safe for me, and have tentatively experimented with various blends. I have had a reaction to as little as 13% wool, and to be quite frank, I am not willing to risk my health on a possible fix when it has such severe consequences for me. So I have stopped using wool altogether. I realize there are some people who get scratchy wool and think they're allergic because it itches and allergies = itchy, however I do in fact have a genuine, diagnosed allergy and I really hate it when people just assume I'm some idiot who knows nothing about fibers whenever I tell them I can't handle wool. And as a side note, it's rather silly to point out the difference between the hair and the lanolin considering that we should all as English speakers know when someone colloquially states ""I am allergic to wool"" or ""I am allergic to cats"" that they aren't referring to every part of the animal but rather the specific oil or dander that induces an allergic response."	ah yes please tell me how the severe allergy i ve had since childhood really works i am perfectly aware that the is what actually causes the allergic reaction and not the hair itself i know this because when i was in elementary school i wore a wool jacket and did not get a rash but rather a very bad case of hives it was so bad my parents were worried that i might have shingles my skin became red and from head to toe and it was so itchy and miserable i could barely move i had to go to the doctor and get prescription allergy medications to combat the reaction and the rash still didn t completely go away for almost an entire week since then i have done a lot of research about what causes allergies like mine what fibers are safe for me and have tentatively experimented with various blends i have had a reaction to as little as wool and to be quite frank i am not willing to risk my health on a possible fix when it has such severe consequences for me so i have stopped using wool altogether i realize there are some people who get scratchy wool and think they re allergic because it itches and allergies itchy however i do in fact have a genuine diagnosed allergy and i really hate it when people just assume i m some idiot who knows nothing about fibers whenever i tell them i can t handle wool and as a side note it s rather silly to point out the difference between the hair and the considering that we should all as english speakers know when someone colloquially states i am allergic to wool or i am allergic to cats that they aren t referring to every part of the animal but rather the specific oil or dander that induces an allergic response 	-0.1401	0.5322	320	1

I always find it difficult not to follow the sleep hygiene advice. I know if I sleep, even for just 30 minutes at about 3:00pm then I will feel a lot better. The problem is that is hard to do if you have a job, and it upsets sleep at night. Hence I try to stay in that 9-5 routine in the hope that one day I will be 'normal'. That said I agree with you that sometime you just need to sleep at odd times. A small amount of feeling refreshed is sometimes enough to give me the strength to get through a bad patch.

If I'm tired I'm socially skills totally disappear. How do to manage when I don't have energy? I've noticed that when I'm tired I'm terrible at socializing. I make stupid comments, I mumble, I can't think of anything to say or what to talk about (unless it's something about myself), I complain about things, I can't hide my emotions, I stumble over my words, I don't listen well, and I'm not as aware of how the people around me are feeling. It's embarrassing and I feel like I don't deal with it as well as other people around me. I find I have a lot more trouble with this at work than anywhere else. This is a real problem because I work at a coffee shop and being tired really kills my ability to interact with customers and coworkers. I can't hold a conversation, and it makes it difficult to connect with the people I work with when I'm having trouble halfway through an eight hour shift. When I'm feeling good and energized I'm usually pretty quick on my feet and friendly, but being even a little tired makes me dull and anxious. Do any of you have advice for staying socially energized? or being able to maintain when I am tired?

Chris, you showed me how inexperienced in life I was. Thanks. I shouldn't think about you anymore, but I do. Kory? I was crazy. I fucked up. You helped me get to that level, but in reality only have myself to blame. Hopefully, someday, you'll be able to date another guy. I think you'll be happier that way. Any one else? You'll never be any of the three men that matter in my life. Those two, and my partner now, the greatest man in the world.

That all the countries that don't have central banks with Western controlled central bankers running things, happen to be the same exact countries that the United States and NATO seem to have problems with. I'm sure that doesn't have anything to do with the fact that these countries want to control their own natural resources and the currency that values them. Just look at the countries the United States is currently beefing with, its the ones that aren't in debt to Anglo-American bankers, like Syria, Iran, North Korea. You can take Iraq and Libya off of that increasingly short list of truly sovereign nations.	that all the countries that don t have central banks with western controlled central bankers running things happen to be the same exact countries that the united states and nato seem to have problems with i m sure that doesn t have anything to do with the fact that these countries want to control their own natural resources and the currency that values them just look at the countries the united states is currently beefing with its the ones that aren t in debt to anglo american bankers like syria iran north korea you can take iraq and libya off of that increasingly short list of truly sovereign nations 	0.145	0.391	109	0

If there is a product that is a huge benefit to society, like magic apples that can feed families, then that sort of thing needs to be taken OUT of private hands. Privatizing essentials of this hypothetical nature is an absolutely horrible idea, and it leads to situations to... wait for it... a corporate monopoly. Personally, I'd much rather have accountability, unfortunately government today is anything but. You throw legislation-mandated profit for multimilionaires in there and it becomes a ticking time bomb of a situation. Just look at the price of *everything* we buy from private hands. If it's expensive in private hands, it goes into someone's pocket. If it's expensive in government hands, it's mismanagement of funds. Shit like Netflix, however, can suck it IMHO, but other things like Wikipedia, using search engines, and things that are generally beneficial/educational should not ever be kept from the public in the name of profit. The problem is, without a completely neutral network it would take a large body of people to constantly sit there and judge what is and what is not acceptable to charge a premium for, so the obvious solution is to let the pipes fill as they will. I'm not sure what I'm trying to say anymore. It's a complicated issue and I've made a poor analogy, but I can say that I am jaded when it comes to my perception of people all sitting around a television day in and day out instead of reading books, educating themselves, or just getting out in general and doing something positive for the world. Thanks for the conversation though. I'm in a bit of a bad mood today and am just venting. --- I don't know why anyone would downvote something like that. It's not like I am really ranting and swearing and being hateful. WTF is wrong with people? It's like once you get down into the depth of a thread people just turn into animals. Jeez.	if there is a product that is a huge benefit to society like magic apples that can feed families then that sort of thing needs to be taken out of private hands privatizing essentials of this hypothetical nature is an absolutely horrible idea and it leads to situations to wait for it a corporate monopoly personally i d much rather have accountability unfortunately government today is anything but you throw legislation mandated profit for in there and it becomes a ticking time bomb of a situation just look at the price of *everything* we buy from private hands if it s expensive in private hands it goes into someone s pocket if it s expensive in government hands it s mismanagement of funds shit like netflix however can suck it imho but other things like wikipedia using search engines and things that are generally beneficial educational should not ever be kept from the public in the name of profit the problem is without a completely neutral network it would take a large body of people to constantly sit there and judge what is and what is not acceptable to charge a premium for so the obvious solution is to let the pipes fill as they will i m not sure what i m trying to say anymore it s a complicated issue and i ve made a poor analogy but i can say that i am jaded when it comes to my perception of people all sitting around a television day in and day out instead of reading books educating themselves or just getting out in general and doing something positive for the world thanks for the conversation though i m in a bit of a bad mood today and am just venting i don t know why anyone would downvote something like that it s not like i am really ranting and swearing and being hateful wtf is wrong with people ? it s like once you get down into the depth of a thread people just turn into animals jeez 	-0.123	0.5107	342	1

"""the terrorists"" You use those words as if you're implying these people are acting as a group, which couldn't be further from reality.

"I regret isolating myself from my peers, and not even taking any part in extracurriculars. Most of the time, I literally went to school and went home to get on the internet, and stayed in my room. Originally, I was very socially awkward due mostly because of my terrible home life, but was still very sociable. Just annoying, though. 7th grade was a terrible year, it was my first year at the junior high, and I was quickly learning how cruel other kids could be. I mean I was annoying, I deserved some of the hate I got, but there were some things that happened that were practically unwarranted. It was around that time that I moved to my grandparent's house to get away from my homelife abuse, and it just came to me that I was tired of other people. So very, very tired. My self esteem was in the pits. I was tired of being the subject of ridicule, of being a psychological punching bag of my peers and family. And I knew it had to do with the fact that I was hopeless at social interaction. I don't know what happened, but it was like some part of my brain just... slowed to a stop when I realized just how shitty everything was. Some part of me broke, I think. I stopped interacting with my peers mostly. I spent a lot of time studying. I pretty much only spoke when I had something witty to say. Soon... people started liking me. My only friend year later told me that someone from one of my classes told her, ""test_subject3112 used to be really weird, but she's cool now"". That's right, I was cool because I wasn't an annoying shit anymore and just shut up. Because of my bad self esteem, this pretty much only reinforced my behavior. While I did learn a great amount of patience from my actions, it is terribly regrettable. I developed severe social anxiety because I have worried so much about making myself presentable to others. I kept silent, I figured shutting up and being obedient and staying out of others way was the best and easiest way to coast through school. Now it is difficult to be employed, to leave my house, to make friends. I am anxious much of the time. I quit my last job due to a panic attack. Apathy has encroached on every aspect of my life. My therapist actually told me my depression is worse than my anxiety. At the time this all started, I could hardly cope with the stress. I'm thinking it is probably a combination of school and home pressure that caused me to break and retreat within myself. I greatly fear rejection. People tell me not to care about what others think, but I have realized from so many years of being alone that people are a part of our lives whether we want them there or not."	i regret isolating myself from my peers and not even taking any part in extracurriculars most of the time i literally went to school and went home to get on the internet and stayed in my room originally i was very socially awkward due mostly because of my terrible home life but was still very sociable just annoying though th grade was a terrible year it was my first year at the junior high and i was quickly learning how cruel other kids could be i mean i was annoying i deserved some of the hate i got but there were some things that happened that were practically unwarranted it was around that time that i moved to my grandparent s house to get away from my abuse and it just came to me that i was tired of other people so very very tired my self esteem was in the pits i was tired of being the subject of ridicule of being a psychological punching bag of my peers and family and i knew it had to do with the fact that i was hopeless at social interaction i don t know what happened but it was like some part of my brain just slowed to a stop when i realized just how shitty everything was some part of me broke i think i stopped interacting with my peers mostly i spent a lot of time studying i pretty much only spoke when i had something witty to say soon people started liking me my only friend year later told me that someone from one of my classes told her used to be really weird but she s cool now that s right i was cool because i wasn t an annoying shit anymore and just shut up because of my bad self esteem this pretty much only reinforced my behavior while i did learn a great amount of patience from my actions it is terribly regrettable i developed severe social anxiety because i have worried so much about making myself presentable to others i kept silent i figured shutting up and being obedient and staying out of others way was the best and easiest way to coast through school now it is difficult to be employed to leave my house to make friends i am anxious much of the time i quit my last job due to a panic attack apathy has encroached on every aspect of my life my therapist actually told me my depression is worse than my anxiety at the time this all started i could hardly cope with the stress i m thinking it is probably a combination of school and home pressure that caused me to break and retreat within myself i greatly fear rejection people tell me not to care about what others think but i have realized from so many years of being alone that people are a part of our lives whether we want them there or not 	-0.0819	0.5293	498	1

It doesn't, necessarily. There are plenty of aces who want to have kids. In fact, it's a pretty common topic over at /r/asexuality. I've seen plenty of people bemoaning how they feel that their sexuality makes it difficult to pursue relationships, marriage, and children.

I have a question about sleep studies. I had one done a while ago. At the time, I was bartending so my normal sleep hours were between 4am and noon. For the sleep study, they made me get there at 8pm and had me in bed to fall to sleep by 9pm. They said I would be woken up around 6am. I also was forced to sleep on my back, because of the wires, but I'm a tummy sleeper. Needless to say, I didn't fall to sleep for hours. The nurse was frustrated. I was miserable. The study didn't tell the doctor anything relevant. I'm wondering, is this common practice for running a sleep study?

TIFU by using a customer at work as a way to keep myself from falling. (3rd time posting, ever, all of which have been here, on /r/tifu. Still safe to say I'm an idiot.) I still clench my butt cheeks thinking about this. It happened a few days ago. Friday night, busy, and crowded. I'm bussing that night, covering some girl's shift. Bussers at my restaurant are practically servers, except we don't take orders. ( we do all the fucking dirty work and deal with bullshit and get less money. ) anyway, I'm clearing plates off of a table, I mean, at least 8 or 9 heavy ass dinner plates, proceed to the next table To clear some more, when I start to lose my footing on spilled beer (I hadn't noticed), and slide my ass into the splits.(I can't do the splits.) About halfway through, I drop all the plates, and violently grab a Patrons shoulder, clinging for dear life before my inner thighs rip open, crying out in pain. I quickly get up, mumble something alone the lines of 'fuckohmygodimsosorryletmegetoutofyourway', run/limp to the walk-in freezer, contemplate suicide, and open the door to find coworkers laughing in my face (not unusual.) I refused to go back into that section after cleaning up. I later had to walk over with my manager and thoroughly apologize while this guy and the rest of his family just stare at me like I just shat on their table. Still haven't forgiven myself.	tifu by using a customer at work as a way to keep myself from falling rd time posting ever all of which have been here on r tifu still safe to say i m an idiot i still clench my butt cheeks thinking about this it happened a few days ago friday night busy and crowded i m that night covering some girl s shift at my restaurant are practically servers except we don t take orders we do all the fucking dirty work and deal with bullshit and get less money anyway i m clearing plates off of a table i mean at least or heavy ass dinner plates proceed to the next table to clear some more when i start to lose my footing on spilled beer i hadn t noticed and slide my ass into the splits i can t do the splits about halfway through i drop all the plates and violently grab a patrons shoulder clinging for dear life before my inner thighs rip open crying out in pain i quickly get up mumble something alone the lines of run limp to the walk in freezer contemplate suicide and open the door to find coworkers laughing in my face not unusual i refused to go back into that section after cleaning up i later had to walk over with my manager and thoroughly apologize while this guy and the rest of his family just stare at me like i just shat on their table still haven t forgiven myself 	-0.0975	0.5845	254	1

There's no requirement under the FLSA to pay you extra money for working a holiday, so, by that metric, you were paid 7 hours at your OT rate, whether they call it holiday or OT is probably not relevant.

I see it as very tricky. As /u/namer98 said, the OT commands it. But there is contradictory information in the NT like /u/I3lindman brought up. Is deadly self-defense technically repaying evil for evil? Peter used it when the soldiers came to take Jesus away and he was rebuked for doing so. However, Humans were given the right to exact the death penalty for murder ( John 19:10-11 ; Rom 13:1-4 ). In the OT, even a thief could be killed in self-defense. Jesus commanded his disciples to arm themselves and the only time Jesus was recorded in rebuking the use of a sword was when Peter was trying to get in the way of Christ's specific purpose to lay down His life. Honestly, if it came down to it I would absolutely use deadly force to protect myself or my family if their lives were being threatened by someone. I don't know if it's a sin, but I know I would go through severe mental anguish if that situation were to become a reality.	i see it as very tricky as u said the ot commands it but there is contradictory information in the nt like u brought up is deadly self defense technically repaying evil for evil ? peter used it when the soldiers came to take jesus away and he was rebuked for doing so however humans were given the right to exact the death penalty for murder john rom in the ot even a thief could be killed in self defense jesus commanded his disciples to arm themselves and the only time jesus was recorded in the use of a sword was when peter was trying to get in the way of christ s specific purpose to lay down his life honestly if it came down to it i would absolutely use deadly force to protect myself or my family if their lives were being threatened by someone i don t know if it s a sin but i know i would go through severe mental anguish if that situation were to become a reality 	-0.0922	0.6462	174	1

I think the part that you are missing here is the threatening sacrifice. In other words, my emotions were manipulated to the point where if I said no I would have been attacked emotionally. From your comment reply, you said this as if some women feel as if they must sacrifice to please their partner. All relationships have sacrifices. However, I was forced to sacrifice for my emotional safety. That type of sacrifice is never okay in any relationship. No one should have to fear the consequences if they want to say no to sex. And I did.	i think the part that you are missing here is the threatening sacrifice in other words my emotions were manipulated to the point where if i said no i would have been attacked emotionally from your comment reply you said this as if some women feel as if they must sacrifice to please their partner all relationships have sacrifices however i was forced to sacrifice for my emotional safety that type of sacrifice is never okay in any relationship no one should have to fear the consequences if they want to say no to sex and i did 	-0.1458	0.5887	98	1

Any suggestions for saving money on one's electric bill? Two friends of mine just moved into my (two-story) house. They (a couple) share a bedroom, and my bedroom is in the basement. Since it's been so cold, we both use 1500W space heaters to keep our respective rooms warm. As a result, the electric bill has jumped to an insane $262 in the last month.

"Lectured by Hypocrisy Tl:Dr. Alcoholic friend lectures me on doing coke once, fails to see hypocrisy in choices. So last night, I went to hang out with some friends I hadn't seen in a while (I transferred colleges). One of them had caught wind that I did coke within the past week, and gave me a huge lecture on how I'm not on the right path, how my life will be ruined, and all that jazz. I'm just venting a bit because I did it once (no redose, no urge to do it again) yet my friend is an alcoholic who will be drunk almost every day of the week (they have about 20 empty handles of Fireball whiskey on display in their kitchen). One friend won't even acknowledge my presence anywhere anymore, and the third guy is cool, and knows I actually have my shit together. So yea, I hate word of mouth and the warped views of addiction people have. Yes, drugs can ruin your life. No, I don't believe you can be hooked on substances after one use. Said friend is like ""yeah, I chew, I drink, I even smoke pot on occassion, but that hard shit will ruin your life."" Well, at least this friend has stopped being anti-marijuana Edit: Removed some phrasing that made me come off worse than intended. 2nd edit: The friend who wasn't acknowledging my presence has been a bit reserved about things lately, and I was told something else was probably on his mind.

So somehow they started out with sexual attraction and having sex, but now she is so unattractive to him that he'd rather fuck his hand alone in front of a screen. Maybe, it's not unheard of that people lose their sexual attraction toward their S.O. And that seems normal and healthy? Seeing that OP is not happy I would say that this is not healthy for the relationship. Really porn has nothing to do with this situation? What do you think he would do if he had no access to porn?

Fuck you Rick Berman! All jokes aside though, I just think there's this thing in movies today where movies with dark tones generally have darker colors. The Empire Strikes Back is the perfect example of having a dark movie, but still being able to have a vibrant color pallet. This kind of makes TDK look a little dull. I get that they're good performances, but the character of Bruce Wayne has very little emotional depth. He's a shallow character, and his intentions can be very easily understood. Same goes for Alfred.	fuck you rick berman ! all jokes aside though i just think there s this thing in movies today where movies with dark tones generally have darker colors the empire strikes back is the perfect example of having a dark movie but still being able to have a vibrant color pallet this kind of makes tdk look a little dull i get that they re good performances but the character of bruce wayne has very little emotional depth he s a shallow character and his intentions can be very easily understood same goes for alfred 	0.1014	0.4562	95	0

I got banned from r/documentaries for reposting this after it was initially removed. They definitely don't want criticism of Israel to become a regular thing over there. About a month ago, I got a documentary about AIPAC to be #1 on r/documentaries with over 1000 upvotes and more than 1000 comments. After I began inquiring to the mods about why my doc kept getting removed and why I was being hassled about reposting it, they accused me of having an agenda and not wanting anyone to use r/documentaries as a platform for anything in particular. When I asked if the fact that the submission was about Israel had anything to do with it being removed, I was derided for being a conspiracy theorist. Shortly thereafter I was banned.

Plenty of kids don't take it seriously enough at all. I've heard about parties where young gay men try to get it as soon as possible so they don't have to worry about going bareback. That's terrifying. I didn't mean to minimize it, just explain that it isn't as awful as it was 30 years ago. Its still not something anyone should want to have; it is still deadly. I'm sorry that my explanation came off as blas like AIDS isn't a terrible thing. For anyone reading this, AIDS is awful and not something to be taken lightly, it's just less awful than it was a few decades ago.	plenty of kids don t take it seriously enough at all i ve heard about parties where young gay men try to get it as soon as possible so they don t have to worry about going bareback that s terrifying i didn t mean to minimize it just explain that it isn t as awful as it was years ago its still not something anyone should want to have it is still deadly i m sorry that my explanation came off as blas like aids isn t a terrible thing for anyone reading this aids is awful and not something to be taken lightly it s just less awful than it was a few decades ago 	-0.3759	0.6733	117	1

The problem is that many heroes in this game are MEANT to excel in the first 20-30 minutes. That's when they're the strongest. These heroes are now punished moreso than before for having their early lead because of an ingame mechanic. These heroes generally fall off in the late game anyway (Viper, QoP are two examples I can think of immediately). There is no need to punish early game dominators harder simply for dominating, when that's the point of the fucking hero.	the problem is that many heroes in this game are meant to excel in the first minutes that s when they re the strongest these heroes are now punished moreso than before for having their early lead because of an ingame mechanic these heroes generally fall off in the late game anyway viper qop are two examples i can think of immediately there is no need to punish early game harder simply for dominating when that s the point of the fucking hero 	-0.1	0.4133	83	1

My Native American doll has been giving off bad vibes since I got her. Before I start my story, I have to explain something. I've never been afraid of dolls. I was allowed to watch Chucky movies when I was little, and I'd go to bed in a room full of dolls without the slightest bit of fear. I've also had some really creepy dolls growing up and they never caused me any discomfort. My mom bought this doll at a flea market around 2009 for me. She said the lady she bought it from let it go for a measly $10. This was $90 less than she was asking for, and apparently she didn't take a lot haggling to agree. That night I put the doll in a corner and went to bed. Right away something was off. I didn't like the fact that the doll was looking right at me. As I said, I love dolls and I have literally dozens of them facing me all around my room. But for some reason, this one was unsettling. Finally I fell asleep. I dreamed that she appeared beside my bed. She didn't move or say anything, but it was a very unpleasant dream. Of course when I woke up she hadn't moved from where I placed her the night before. Later that year I moved out of my parents' house and took the doll with me (I took most of my dolls with me). You're probably wondering why I didn't leave the one giving me the willies behind. It was because I thought I was being really silly. And I didn't want to hurt my mom's feelings. It was really a nice doll and she thought I would like it. Anyway, the doll was putting off the same vibes in the house I was renting with roommates. I eventually put the doll into my closet because I learned she didn't have to be staring at me to make me uncomfortable; she only had to be in the room. It didn't help. I imaged the closet door slowly creeping open at night while I slept. The roommate situation didn't work out (nothing to do with the doll though) so I moved back in with my parents. By this time I was used to being creeped out as I slept so I just put the doll in the corner there she stayed for a few years. Only it got a little worse. I began hearing voices whispering in my room. I could never make out what was being said, but it would always happen when I was trying to go to bed. I kept having that same dream where I would look over to the side of my bed and there she would be, staring at me. This kept up until 2013, when I moved in with my boyfriend. My boyfriend *hates* dolls and flat out forbade me to bring any into his house. He calls them creepy demon portals. So I left them all with my parents. I didn't have the dream anymore and I didn't think of the doll again until this summer, 2014. My boyfriend had to leave the state because of a family crisis for awhile, so I moved back in with my parents. When I entered my room, I didn't notice anything funny. I didn't really notice any of the dozens of dolls around my room. I just laid down and went to sleep. For the first time in forever, I had the dream again. This time I heard the whispering in the dream, which I never had before. It always occurred as I was going to sleep, but I didn't hear it once I had drifted off. When I woke up I noticed the doll was gone. Very concerned, I asked my mother what the deal was. She said my grandma had stayed over and slept in my room, but was so creeped out about the doll, she asked my mom to move it into another room. So the doll was now in my sister's vacant bedroom. (My sister was living elsewear.) This part really freaked me out. I always thought maybe the voices and the dream were products of suggestion. The doll was creepy, so thinking of her created voices in my imagination and some bad dreams. But why would that happen when I hadn't even noticed the doll was missing? I hadn't been thinking of her at all when I went to sleep. Another big red flag is that my grandma was creeped out by it too. I've collected dolls since I was little, and my grandma had never before had an issue with any of the dolls in my room. Just the Native American doll. Here's a picture of the doll: http://i.imgur.com/5cP0eAj.png I tried to do some research on it, like if it was mass producted and if anyone else found them creepy. I can't find anything at all. One last thing I should add: I never named the doll. I always name my dolls. It's just that I've been a little put off by this one, so I never bothered to name her. My boyfriend joked that she's probably just annoyed I didn't give her a name.	my native american doll has been giving off bad vibes since i got her before i start my story i have to explain something i ve never been afraid of dolls i was allowed to watch chucky movies when i was little and i d go to bed in a room full of dolls without the slightest bit of fear i ve also had some really creepy dolls growing up and they never caused me any discomfort my mom bought this doll at a flea market around for me she said the lady she bought it from let it go for a measly this was less than she was asking for and apparently she didn t take a lot haggling to agree that night i put the doll in a corner and went to bed right away something was off i didn t like the fact that the doll was looking right at me as i said i love dolls and i have literally dozens of them facing me all around my room but for some reason this one was unsettling finally i fell asleep i dreamed that she appeared beside my bed she didn t move or say anything but it was a very unpleasant dream of course when i woke up she hadn t moved from where i placed her the night before later that year i moved out of my parents house and took the doll with me i took most of my dolls with me you re probably wondering why i didn t leave the one giving me the willies behind it was because i thought i was being really silly and i didn t want to hurt my mom s feelings it was really a nice doll and she thought i would like it anyway the doll was putting off the same vibes in the house i was renting with roommates i eventually put the doll into my closet because i learned she didn t have to be staring at me to make me uncomfortable she only had to be in the room it didn t help i imaged the closet door slowly creeping open at night while i slept the roommate situation didn t work out nothing to do with the doll though so i moved back in with my parents by this time i was used to being creeped out as i slept so i just put the doll in the corner there she stayed for a few years only it got a little worse i began hearing voices whispering in my room i could never make out what was being said but it would always happen when i was trying to go to bed i kept having that same dream where i would look over to the side of my bed and there she would be staring at me this kept up until when i moved in with my boyfriend my boyfriend dolls and flat out forbade me to bring any into his house he calls them creepy demon portals so i left them all with my parents i didn t have the dream anymore and i didn t think of the doll again until this summer my boyfriend had to leave the state because of a family crisis for awhile so i moved back in with my parents when i entered my room i didn t notice anything funny i didn t really notice any of the dozens of dolls around my room i just laid down and went to sleep for the first time in forever i had the dream again this time i heard the whispering in the dream which i never had before it always occurred as i was going to sleep but i didn t hear it once i had drifted off when i woke up i noticed the doll was gone very concerned i asked my mother what the deal was she said my grandma had stayed over and slept in my room but was so creeped out about the doll she asked my mom to move it into another room so the doll was now in my sister s vacant bedroom my sister was living this part really freaked me out i always thought maybe the voices and the dream were products of suggestion the doll was creepy so thinking of her created voices in my imagination and some bad dreams but why would that happen when i hadn t even noticed the doll was missing ? i hadn t been thinking of her at all when i went to sleep another big red flag is that my grandma was creeped out by it too i ve collected dolls since i was little and my grandma had never before had an issue with any of the dolls in my room just the native american doll here s a picture of the doll i tried to do some research on it like if it was mass and if anyone else found them creepy i can t find anything at all one last thing i should add i never named the doll i always name my dolls it s just that i ve been a little put off by this one so i never bothered to name her my boyfriend joked that she s probably just annoyed i didn t give her a name 	-0.12	0.4148	897	1

"Are we disposable people? I'm laying in bed unable to sleep and that question keeps popping in my head. I feel like I could disappear tomorrow and my ""friends"" wouldn't notice for months potentially years. Trying to meet new people seems like someone is playing a joke on me. Respond to an ad on r4r, LITERALLY contacting someone who claims that want to talk and it must just be anyone but me. Then you have the ""professionals"" who are there to help you. It's really hard to take what they say to heart when you know it'd look pretty bad for them if you went out and offed yourself. It's just REALLY hard to tell when someone cares even a little bit anymore. And it's amusing to me because the only thing I want to do in response to all of this ""lack"" of attention is just kill any and all means of communication with people. Stop seeing the therapist, stop taking meds, remove contacts from Facebook, remove any and all messaging apps, delete this account, etc. Stupid way to approach the lonely problem, but seems completely logical when I'm thinking on it.

I remember getting into epic battles with my mother over wearing dresses to church, but I was not having any of that shit. I'm 23 now and am no longer uncomfortable with myself.

I agree. David Ayer nor Zack Snyder are perfect directors, with that said they have done VERY good movies in the past. End of Watch is one of the most underrated movies of the decade and, personally, I enjoyed 300, Man of Steel (although far from perfect)and Watchmen. I'm hoping they don't stuff up the iconic characters they are dealing with.

Anime can be a bit hard to get into, with that said I'm gonna list some of my favorites with a small summary and you can check out which one if any sounds enticing. Cowboy BeBop - considered to be the best anime ever made it focuses on a group of bounty hunters in space and there various adventures. Each episode is pretty much self contained but there is a plot line of each character that by the end is wrapped up fully and very well done. Check out the episode Pierrot Le Fou. Afro samurai - the story focuses on afro as he kills and kills some more too reach the man who killed his father infront of him as a child. Full of action, violence, revenge, some feels and a sound track by RZA def check it out. Samurai Champloo - the story of a girl who hires two samurai to help her find the samurai who smells of sunflowers, its full of style, action, comedy and imo on par with bebop as one of the greats. Panty and Stocking - made by the people who made KLK story is about two angels. Panty (a foul mouth nyphomaniac) and Stocking (a goth girl who loves sweets) who must kill ghost to collect coins to get back into heaven. This one is a non stop ride of comedy, pop culture refrences, stylised violence, and absurd fun. It doesn't take its self seriously and its better for it. Paranoia Agent - Do you like trippy mind fucks because that's what it is. A town is terrorized by Lil Slugger a kid on roller blades who attacks people with a baseball bat. Good style, good story a d kinda weird but totes worth it. Trigun - A wild west type anime, focuses on Vash the Stampede in his travels fighting off bounty hunters, over the top villians and two insurance girls, too find Peace And Love. But in all seriousness its a great series loved by most for good reason. When they cry - don't let the cute girls fool you this shit gets dark, like real dark. The story is split up into a few diffrent storys each containing a few episodes. Full of curses, tourtue, violence, some feels. Its not a trip for the faint of heart. FLCL - zany, over the top, weird, stylish and a lot more. I could say more but its only six episodes go watch it. Lain - a story of girl and her computer. There's way more to it than that but this is one of those ones where you watch it and you go wtf then you watch it again and go. Ooooh. Mind fuckey and very good imo. BUT YOU DONT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND.

My mistake. It's a little different then, but I still think it would be a shocking idea to say I love you regardless of how he feels about you.

I often feel like it comes worst at times when it feels like it's appropriate to say something, but I just have nothing to say I have some idea of what I'm going to say, but by the time I get to actually saying it it comes out a mess. For example, I was trying to relay to my brother what I thought about a business idea he'd come up with and why his educational background gives him an advantage in the field he's hoping to go into, but it just came out a complete disaster and made the conversation awkward.	i often feel like it comes worst at times when it feels like it s appropriate to say something but i just have nothing to say i have some idea of what i m going to say but by the time i get to actually saying it it comes out a mess for example i was trying to relay to my brother what i thought about a business idea he d come up with and why his educational background gives him an advantage in the field he s hoping to go into but it just came out a complete disaster and made the conversation awkward 	-0.1321	0.758	105	1
My 10 is probably about a 7-7.5 for most of you. For others, it would probably be considered higher, and for the rest, it could even be a 3. Pain tolerance is dependent on the person, and I know for me, a 10 is when I can't walk (Early-Onset Arthritis.) My knee is in so much pain, I have to judge just how badly I need to use the restroom before getting out of bed just to walk across the hall. My SO has on more than one occasion had to go to the kitchen for me just to get me some water because I'm at a 6 for me. A 6 cripples me, a 10 just means that I can't move at all, for fear of passing out. Unfortunately for me, if I'm having a day when I reach a 10 and still need to go to work, I have to push through due to the fact that my job requires I be on my feet all day. Those are the worst days for me, because no one at my office knows that I have arthritis in my knee.	my is probably about a for most of you for others it would probably be considered higher and for the rest it could even be a pain tolerance is dependent on the person and i know for me a is when i can t walk early onset arthritis my knee is in so much pain i have to judge just how badly i need to use the restroom before getting out of bed just to walk across the hall my so has on more than one occasion had to go to the kitchen for me just to get me some water because i m at a for me a cripples me a just means that i can t move at all for fear of passing out unfortunately for me if i m having a day when i reach a and still need to go to work i have to push through due to the fact that my job requires i be on my feet all day those are the worst days for me because no one at my office knows that i have arthritis in my knee 	-0.1094	0.655	187	1

"Why is Jesus referred to as God's one and only Son? I never understood this. Jesus is a part of the Trinity, therefore He is God through the trinitarian relationship with God the ""Father"" and the Holy Spirit. Does that make the Holy Spirit the crazy uncle of the bunch who watches us when we sleep? To me, Jesus being the Son of God seems to imply that God the Father has supreme authority, but that's not the way the Trinity works. They're all equally God and in sync with one another.

NSV: Finally made my mom lose weight. Even though my parents never had eating habits that were that good, they weren't fat when I was a kid. However, I was: I became overweight by the age of 11 and was in that state until I was 15, when I started exercising and learning about nutrition and counting calories. It took me 5 years to drop down to 12-13% body fat, and the whole process of becoming fat and then losing all the weight had a huge impact on the person I became, positively and negatively. But I never blamed my parents, because they never knew better. Nonetheless, what goes around comes around I guess, since as they became older they also became overweight. But instead of blaming them, I decided to help them lose their weight. My dad has been more reluctant to change his habits, and he drinks way too much alcohol (you shouldn't drink alcohol period, in my opinion). On the other hand, my mom agreed to go on a strict diet and start weight lifting about 6 months ago, and as of today she has lost 35 pounds. She didn't want me to post pictures, but she went from 155 pounds and about 40% body fat to 120 pounds and close to 25% body fat, and she feels great. I don't have any siblings, so for me it's important that my parents live long and healthy lives despite their lack of knowledge, and I'm working hard on it. Now I need to get on my dad's case, and I can already tell it's gonna be one hell of a ride, but I'm staying positive!!	nsv finally made my mom lose weight even though my parents never had eating habits that were that good they weren t fat when i was a kid however i was i became overweight by the age of and was in that state until i was when i started exercising and learning about nutrition and counting calories it took me years to drop down to body fat and the whole process of becoming fat and then losing all the weight had a huge impact on the person i became positively and negatively but i never blamed my parents because they never knew better nonetheless what goes around comes around i guess since as they became older they also became overweight but instead of blaming them i decided to help them lose their weight my dad has been more reluctant to change his habits and he drinks way too much alcohol you shouldn t drink alcohol period in my opinion on the other hand my mom agreed to go on a strict diet and start weight lifting about months ago and as of today she has lost pounds she didn t want me to post pictures but she went from pounds and about body fat to pounds and close to body fat and she feels great i don t have any siblings so for me it s important that my parents live long and healthy lives despite their lack of knowledge and i m working hard on it now i need to get on my dad s case and i can already tell it s gonna be one hell of a ride but i m staying positive ! ! 	0.2307	0.3103	278	0

I haven't been through potty training our son yet but this is from personal experience. My #1 tip is if he's not ready and having lots of accidents, don't force him to stay in big boy underwear. I was forced into panties at 3 years old and was terrified of having an accident, so I held in my poop (also called encopresis). This led to painful trips to the bathroom and it was a vicious cycle that wasn't fixed until I had sheer willpower at the age of 12. Now my mom says she should have listened to her friends and put me back in pull-ups. They had literally tried everything, including rewards, punishments, etc... and nothing worked. I know this isn't typical, I'm just passing on the information from my mom.	i haven t been through potty training our son yet but this is from personal experience my tip is if he s not ready and having lots of accidents don t force him to stay in big boy underwear i was forced into panties at years old and was terrified of having an accident so i held in my poop also called encopresis this led to painful trips to the bathroom and it was a vicious cycle that wasn t fixed until i had sheer willpower at the age of now my mom says she should have listened to her friends and put me back in pull ups they had literally tried everything including rewards punishments etc and nothing worked i know this isn t typical i m just passing on the information from my mom 	-0.1879	0.633	136	1

You Are Not So Smart My current read. If you doubt your rational choices or if you think you are one supreme intelligent and rational creature, this book is for you. [You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself by David McRaney](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11709037-you-are-not-so-smart). Whether youre deciding which smart phone to purchase or which politician to believe, you think you are a rational being whose every decision is based on cool, detached logic, but heres the truth: You are not so smart. Youre just as deluded as the rest of us--but thats okay, because being deluded is part of being human. Growing out of David McRaneys popular blog, You Are Not So Smart reveals that every decision we make, every thought we contemplate, and every emotion we feel comes with a story we tell ourselves to explain them, but often these stories arent true. Each short chapter--covering topics such as Learned Helplessness, Selling Out, and the Illusion of Transparency--is like a psychology course with all the boring parts taken out. Bringing together popular science and psychology with humor and wit, You Are Not So Smart is a celebration of our irrational, thoroughly human behavior.	you are not so smart my current read if you doubt your rational choices or if you think you are one supreme intelligent and rational creature this book is for you you are not so smart why you have too many friends on facebook why your memory is mostly fiction and other ways you re deluding yourself by david whether youre deciding which smart phone to purchase or which politician to believe you think you are a rational being whose every decision is based on cool detached logic but heres the truth you are not so smart youre just as deluded as the rest of us but thats okay because being deluded is part of being human growing out of david popular blog you are not so smart reveals that every decision we make every thought we contemplate and every emotion we feel comes with a story we tell ourselves to explain them but often these stories arent true each short chapter covering topics such as learned helplessness selling out and the illusion of transparency is like a psychology course with all the boring parts taken out bringing together popular science and psychology with humor and wit you are not so smart is a celebration of our irrational thoroughly human behavior 	0.2077	0.5935	211	0

I don't know the answers to all of these things, but I know some of them, but only in a relative sense. In general, the more protection (barriers and prophylactic medication) is used, the less is the transmission rate, but it will never be zero, unfortunately. It appears that female genitalia are more likely to become infected during oral sex than male, likely because the epithelial skin of the labia is more conducive to microabrasions than the skin of the penis. Bottom line: there do appear to be differences in the rate of transmission, but it is hard to be absolute about these. Suffice to say, your risk will never be zero.	i don t know the answers to all of these things but i know some of them but only in a relative sense in general the more protection barriers and medication is used the less is the transmission rate but it will never be zero unfortunately it appears that female genitalia are more likely to become infected during oral sex than male likely because the epithelial skin of the labia is more conducive to than the skin of the penis bottom line there do appear to be differences in the rate of transmission but it is hard to be absolute about these suffice to say your risk will never be zero 	0.0565	0.475	111	0

Talented musicians of Reddit, a challenge! Will someone please write my dog a theme song? The dog in question is Apollo, a springer spaniel/golden retriever mix. I often sing to him about his greatness, his beauty, and his strength, but I'm no songwriter, and I think he deserves an anthem of sorts. I know that a song about Apollo would make my boyfriend incredibly happy, so this is a surprise of sorts for him! First off, here are some photos of Apollo for inspiration: http://pineappleblurt.imgur.com/apollo#38wmp Now, some Apollo facts: - I often sing of how he crunches the bones of his enemies, and that he is the destroyer of Tirmok, and had pillaged and burned many villages and thatched roofed cottages. - Apollo loves the water. He also loves tennis balls, bones, eating, and his eternal love -- our neighbor Deb. - According to Apollo, no one ever feeds him. Dinner time for him is all the time. - He was named not for the god Apollo, but for Apollo from Battlestar Galactica. - He has a superhero alter ego named DarkFart, who fights crime under the cover of darkness. This doesn't have to be an original melody. Something epic sounding, like the Soviet national anthem, would be incredible. Silly lyrics, about Apollo's unrivaled awesomeness, strength, and beauty, are a must. :D Forward songwriters! I hope someone accepts my challenge! If I end up with an mp3 of a song all about Apollo, I'll be the happiest girl alive.

Heat 1 spoon of olive oil in a pot with tight lid 2. Boil water in a separate pot (or use water boiler) 3. Add 1 chopped onion to the heated oil. Saute until soft and transparent. 4. Add 1 cup of rice to the pot. Stir it so it will all be covered in oil. about 2-3 minutes. This will prevent the rice from sticking, and it also hardens it a little. 5. At this point your water should be boiled and ready. 6. Add 1.75 cups of boiled water. Add another cup for extra cups of rice you used (so if you cooked 2 cups of rice, that would be 2.75 cups of water). 7. Stir just a little, make sure the water is boiling again and reduce the heat to a simmer (pretty much the minimal heat). 8. Let it cook for 20 minutes, don't touch it. 9. After 20 minutes, the onion should be on top of the rice and no water left in the pot. Uncover, stir gently with a fork, let it rest for 10 minutes. 10. That's it. Now, the time of the cooking and the water ratio varies. It depends on the type of rice (short, medium or long grain, where it came from, etc.). So the best practice is to try on your favorite type and adjust the time and the water until you get a perfect result for your taste.	here s the my method of cooking a perfect rice in a pot it works every time for me it always tastes better than rice cooker so give it a try heat spoon of olive oil in a pot with tight lid boil water in a separate pot or use water boiler add chopped onion to the heated oil saute until soft and transparent add cup of rice to the pot stir it so it will all be covered in oil about minutes this will prevent the rice from sticking and it also hardens it a little at this point your water should be boiled and ready add cups of boiled water add another cup for extra cups of rice you used so if you cooked cups of rice that would be cups of water stir just a little make sure the water is boiling again and reduce the heat to a simmer pretty much the minimal heat let it cook for minutes don t touch it after minutes the onion should be on top of the rice and no water left in the pot uncover stir gently with a fork let it rest for minutes that s it now the time of the cooking and the water ratio varies it depends on the type of rice short medium or long grain where it came from etc so the best practice is to try on your favorite type and adjust the time and the water until you get a perfect result for your taste 	0.2623	0.0	254	0

I had a pet dwarf rabbit when I was a kid and the cat got it and killed it. I smacked the cat to try to make it drop it but I couldn't make it drop it without hurting the cat, and I didn't want to break it's jaw. The dog was barking, it was chaos, but the cat just hung tight until it was dead. Worst pet combo ever. Now, I wouldn't ever keep a cat with an animal that could be it's prey. We got mice for pets once, that drove the cat insane. The cat would refuse to eat anything else until it got the mice. One day I came home and the cat had knocked the cage over and broken it. Weird thing is that cat was so gentle with humans - no scratching or biting or anything, just cute and cuddly.	i had a pet dwarf rabbit when i was a kid and the cat got it and killed it i smacked the cat to try to make it drop it but i couldn t make it drop it without hurting the cat and i didn t want to break it s jaw the dog was barking it was chaos but the cat just hung tight until it was dead worst pet combo ever now i wouldn t ever keep a cat with an animal that could be it s prey we got mice for pets once that drove the cat insane the cat would refuse to eat anything else until it got the mice one day i came home and the cat had knocked the cage over and broken it weird thing is that cat was so gentle with humans no scratching or biting or anything just cute and cuddly 	-0.3087	0.551	150	1

Yes, I am passionate about North Korea, but I don't care if someone doesn't want to go there or not. However, if you're gonna give bullshit reasons, I sure as hell will tell you those reasons are bullshit. I don't understand why people from the Western World are so self-righteous about what they consider right or wrong. Like shit. If you're going to another country, there are laws you may not be used to and may not agree with, but they're there and just fucking respect them. Like if you go to Saudi Arabia, don't be stupid and drive up to the Mecca without being Muslim. If you're in Iran, don't be dumb and walk in a Mosque with your shoes on. You will get in deep shit trouble if break those rules, and honestly you'll deserve it because you had the opportunity to know about those rules, and you chose not to respect them. If you think dumb tourists being arrested and being treated like shit is enough reason not to go to a country, you're basically saying you can't help but be dumb, or you're better than those rules and shall not abide to them. Which is just stupid.	yes i am passionate about north korea but i don t care if someone doesn t want to go there or not however if you re gonna give bullshit reasons i sure as hell will tell you those reasons are bullshit i don t understand why people from the western world are so self righteous about what they consider right or wrong like shit if you re going to another country there are laws you may not be used to and may not agree with but they re there and just fucking respect them like if you go to saudi arabia don t be stupid and drive up to the mecca without being muslim if you re in iran don t be dumb and walk in a mosque with your shoes on you will get in deep shit trouble if break those rules and honestly you ll deserve it because you had the opportunity to know about those rules and you chose not to respect them if you think dumb tourists being arrested and being treated like shit is enough reason not to go to a country you re basically saying you can t help but be dumb or you re better than those rules and shall not abide to them which is just stupid 	-0.1468	0.7	215	1
"Once me and a friend saw a ball of flies consisting of around 4 flies; rolling around very fast, about the speed of a bowling ball. This was at school.

At a school camp I fell into a ditch playing a game and broke my arm. I couldn't sleep because of the pain, and went to tell the teacher that I thought I'd sprained it. She told me to take a drink of water and go back to bed. I cried myself to sleep. Then the next day a friend had a bandage so I put it on. The teacher told me to take it off because it was dirty. I didn't participate in archery or abseiling which is unusual for me because I love those two things, but she kept treating me like I was overreacting. I got an x-ray 2 days later and it showed a fracture of the wrist. I got a cast and returned to school.

"Odd symptoms accompanying headache? I am 18, a female and I have anemia. I do not take iron supplements for x and y reasons. I have daily headaches. It's been like this for a couple of years, maybe more. I believe they are migraines. Usually, I feel my temples pulsating, which per se is not always painful but always so disconcerting. If I concentrate enough, I can get rid of the pain but the unsettling part is always there. Lately, for the past week or so, it's been worse. I feel as if my head splits in two (a physical head and a more ""spiritual"" one, if that makes sense) at each pulse, the pain goes all the way to my neck, and sometimes (for a short period of time), to my left arm.

Anyone have any advice? Anxiety is making me trip up every time I talk to someone. I often pause and get caught up midway through a sentence. It's making my social anxiety even worse than it already is, because it's usually better if I just don't say anything. I know what I'm trying to say, but when I'm trying to say it I usually stumble. When I stumble I usually defer to longer words and it just comes across very awkward. Now that I'm thinking about how I speak all the time it's just gotten worse.

I'm not use to having to pull my skin so it is stretched, so I'm probably not doing it 100% the way it should be. Update: using the lower faucet helped with the lather. Ended up knicking my underarm - trying to hold the razor, pull the skin, and shave with basically one hand is harder than anticipated.	shaving legs in the sink is doable just not ideal i ll try switching the water tomorrow when i shave to see if that helps i have not used pre shave oil i m not use to having to pull my skin so it is stretched so i m probably not doing it the way it should be update using the lower faucet helped with the lather ended up my underarm trying to hold the razor pull the skin and shave with basically one hand is harder than anticipated 	-0.2	0.203	89	1
Cassiopeia. If you can't effectively use her combos you're basically useless.

I love the South and much like Cascadia and New England, I believe it deserves a regional flag of its own. However, the old symbols of the Confederacy are much too divisive to represent a region and its aspirations for the future. Therefore, I felt compelled to use what little graphic design skill I have to put forward a replacement. The 13 stripes represent the 13 states usually associated with the South. The three stars represent the past, which we must ever be mindful of; the present, whose importance needs no mentioning; and the future with all the promise it holds. The triangular motif is to represent the dynamics of time and the mending of past rifts, symbolizing the desire most Southerners have to mend the wounds of the past and move forward as part of a country we love. This point is exemplified in the joining of the two red stripes bordering the blue triangle. What do you think? Comments and suggestions are much appreciated. I just wanted to have a flag that all Southerners - white, black, asian, and latin could fly proudly as a banner of their home region. EDIT: Might as well ask so I can tell what I'm doing wrong, but why's this topic suddenly getting downvoted?	i love the south and much like cascadia and new england i believe it deserves a regional flag of its own however the old symbols of the confederacy are much too divisive to represent a region and its aspirations for the future therefore i felt compelled to use what little graphic design skill i have to put forward a replacement the stripes represent the states usually associated with the south the three stars represent the past which we must ever be mindful of the present whose importance needs no mentioning and the future with all the promise it holds the triangular motif is to represent the dynamics of time and the mending of past rifts symbolizing the desire most southerners have to mend the wounds of the past and move forward as part of a country we love this point is exemplified in the joining of the two red stripes bordering the blue triangle what do you think ? comments and suggestions are much appreciated i just wanted to have a flag that all southerners white black asian and latin could fly proudly as a banner of their home region edit might as well ask so i can tell what i m doing wrong but why s this topic suddenly getting downvoted ? 	0.0993	0.3405	213	0

As a pregnant women, there is also a list of vitamins that we *shouldn't* consume, and others that we shouldn't consume in high quantities. So that is just as important to monitor, as what you *should* be taking. That's why prenatals, across the board, are safe and amazing.

I can understand what you are saying. But I think a lot of your emotions are misplaced. But maybe that's based on my general ignorance on the topic of fat acceptance. I don't believe overweight people want society to start telling them they are healthy, or society to say, it's okay, it's out of your control. I think they just want empathy. I also think they want it to be socially acceptable for people to be overweight, in that people look at it as a lifestyle choice rather than a fault in their moral character. Now, I'm not sure how I feel about that. I don't believe you are morally worse because you are obese. If I see an obese person I admit I do believe they have an emotional problem that makes them eat to excess. And maybe that's wrong, I don't know. I don't think anyone chooses to be overweight as a lifestyle. Why would you? But maybe they just want others to stop shaming them. I think, especially on Reddit, we make a lot of assumptions about someone's character if they are overweight. Lazy and stupid come to mind. And we make those types of comments even when the person's weight isn't the focus of a post. We take pictures of fat people and mock them. Just for existing and being overweight. And I think that's wrong. It's a complicated issue and I'll stop rambling now haha. Thanks for replying to me. I find a lot of the time on here I want to have a discussion with someone who has an opinion different from mine but it usually never happens!

You've been through a lot and suffered a lot of hurt so I'm not surprised you are feeling low. From what you have said it sounded like you were in a toxic relationship and it's good that you have walked away from that. Nobody deserves to be treated like that. And also, there is no way you deserved to be raped. It's crazy that people would say that to you! They're outright wrong.

Doctors of Reddit, what do you do when you see a patient is obviously faking it? Would love to hear some opinions about this because I have pulled this trick aswell when I was younger, claiming I was sick to skip school or for whatever reason. The doctor usually came by and always declared me sick for a few days after heaving heard me symptoms and doing a brief check. Now I wonder if they knew I was faking but just played along (they got payed anyhow..) or because it's out of safety 'what if he really is sick, I don't notice it and something bad happens. Hope this explanation makes sense, english is not my native language. Thanks for the replies! EDIT: Holy..

"Can you really teach someone HTNGAF? I like what this subreddit represents and all, but I feel like not giving a fuck is either in you or it isn't. The guy that got dumped by his ex on Valentine's Day isn't going to all of a sudden stop being depressed because of a few words on here. It takes multiple failures and an internal resolution to get to that point. And the time it takes for that to happen is different for everyone. Most people have to get to a point where they decide *""enough is enough!""* and change their life. I'll leave you with a quote from Anthony De Mello. It's in the context of relationships but I think it applies here: ""It didn’t make sense to me for many years until I suddenly discovered that people have to suffer enough in a relationship so that they get disillusioned with all relationships. Isn’t that a terrible thing to think? They’ve got to suffer enough in a relationship before they wake up and say, “I’m sick of it! There must be a better way of living than depending on another human being.” And what was I doing as a psychotherapist? People were coming to me with their relationship problems, with their communication problems, etc., and sometimes what I did was a help. But sometimes, I’m sorry to say, it wasn’t, because it kept people asleep. Maybe they should have suffered a little more. Maybe they ought to touch rock bottom and say, “I’m sick of it all.” **It’s only when you’re sick of your sickness that you’ll get out of it.** Most people go to a psychiatrist or a psychologist to get relief. I repeat: to get relief. Not to get out of it"""	can you really teach someone ? i like what this subreddit represents and all but i feel like not giving a fuck is either in you or it isn t the guy that got dumped by his ex on valentine s day isn t going to all of a sudden stop being depressed because of a few words on here it takes multiple failures and an internal resolution to get to that point and the time it takes for that to happen is different for everyone most people have to get to a point where they decide enough is enough ! and change their life i ll leave you with a quote from anthony de it s in the context of relationships but i think it applies here it didn ’ t make sense to me for many years until i suddenly discovered that people have to suffer enough in a relationship so that they get disillusioned with all relationships isn ’ t that a terrible thing to think ? they ’ ve got to suffer enough in a relationship before they wake up and say “ i ’ m sick of it ! there must be a better way of living than depending on another human being ” and what was i doing as a psychotherapist ? people were coming to me with their relationship problems with their communication problems etc and sometimes what i did was a help but sometimes i ’ m sorry to say it wasn ’ t because it kept people asleep maybe they should have suffered a little more maybe they ought to touch rock bottom and say “ i ’ m sick of it all ” it ’ s only when you ’ re sick of your sickness that you ’ ll get out of it most people go to a psychiatrist or a psychologist to get relief i repeat to get relief not to get out of it 	-0.0764	0.5511	326	1

Actually this isn't really true anymore. While obviously you shouldn't use a tourniquet for minor wounds, experience in Iraq and Afghanistan has shown that the risk of limb loss has been vastly overstated. Using a tourniquet is reasonable for any bleeding that can't be controlled with direct pressure or repositioning. Every soldier in on patrol in Afghanistan carries a minimum of 4 tourniquets, one for each limb. edit from your link: In rare situations tourniquet application will be necessary and lifesaving in the civilian prehospital setting. Tourniquets are no longer only considered as a last resort device. Practitioners should familiarise themselves with this simple piece of equipment and be prepared to use it in appropriate cases without an irrational fear of complications tl;dr- if you can't stop the bleeding with direct pressure or repositioning use a tourniquet because the benefits almost certainly outweigh the risks.	actually this isn t really true anymore while obviously you shouldn t use a tourniquet for minor wounds experience in iraq and afghanistan has shown that the risk of limb loss has been vastly overstated using a tourniquet is reasonable for any bleeding that can t be controlled with direct pressure or repositioning every soldier in on patrol in afghanistan carries a minimum of one for each limb edit from your link in rare situations tourniquet application will be necessary and lifesaving in the civilian setting are no longer only considered as a last resort device practitioners should themselves with this simple piece of equipment and be prepared to use it in appropriate cases without an irrational fear of complications tl dr if you can t stop the bleeding with direct pressure or repositioning use a tourniquet because the benefits almost certainly outweigh the risks 	0.1143	0.5767	145	0

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)** It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes. **[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)** A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors. **[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)** With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs. **[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)** A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range. **[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)** Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet. **[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)** Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12. **[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)** Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians, these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns.

Fair enough and thankyou for your response. I have to say, that whenever my situation with my daughter is brought up-people judge regardless of how much information I give them. It seems that a Father having access issues to his children is nothing new. Which I feel is disgusting and don't agree with. I would never stop my daughter seeing her Father unless I felt she was in serious danger in his care. Unfortunately her Father isn't on the same wave length. However when it's the Mother having the problems, people always seem to think that she must have done something terrible to not have her children. The only reason I lost in court was due to my lack maturity and knowledge at 19. This is when the custody battles began. I'm now 23 and am going back to court in two weeks to have the current court order re enforced. As usual. I have to pay out for it. I earned nat min wage with is about £850 after tax a month. Maintenance is £125. I'm barely left with anything after that. If I didn't have my partner-I'd starve.	fair enough and thankyou for your response i have to say that whenever my situation with my daughter is brought up people judge regardless of how much information i give them it seems that a father having access issues to his children is nothing new which i feel is disgusting and don t agree with i would never stop my daughter seeing her father unless i felt she was in serious danger in his care unfortunately her father isn t on the same wave length however when it s the mother having the problems people always seem to think that she must have done something terrible to not have her children the only reason i lost in court was due to my lack maturity and knowledge at this is when the custody battles began i m now and am going back to court in two weeks to have the current court order re enforced as usual i have to pay out for it i earned nat min wage with is about after tax a month maintenance is i m barely left with anything after that if i didn t have my partner i d starve 	-0.1448	0.4678	195	1

Exactly. And in most cases they are just curious. For me the worst is when they just want to give me advice like they know what I am going through because they pulled a muscle once. I hate being treated like I'm just not taking care of myself. As if I would be in this much pain and not be doing everything in my power to fix it. Like if I were to just exercise it would fix everything (except how that is what caused the problem). But apparently I am just lazy.	exactly and in most cases they are just curious for me the worst is when they just want to give me advice like they know what i am going through because they pulled a muscle once i hate being treated like i m just not taking care of myself as if i would be in this much pain and not be doing everything in my power to fix it like if i were to just exercise it would fix everything except how that is what caused the problem but apparently i am just lazy 	-0.1437	0.6043	94	1

I drink Gatorade when I'm doing sport, but if you just want to rehydrate without the sugars, you can have electrolyte rehydration tables. Not sure what they're called in the US but in Australia they're called Hydralyte and Gastrolyte. They are good if you are dehydrated and need to encourage your body to absorb the water without all the extra sugars that are in some of the sports drinks like Gatorade and Powerade. Energy drinks are not used for the purposes of rehydration, and they taste terrible.

Useless. I was in a minor fender-bender the other week, 3 distinctly different cars. After 15 minutes getting everyone's tax details etc., the Senior Garda still didn't know which car belonged to who and accused one of the drivers of giving him incorrect info. Until it was pointed out to him that he was looking at the wrong car. Never mind the Ban Garda sent out around the town on her own, got a coat thrown over her and beaten up. She was sent out on her own again a few weeks later. A local thug who assaulted a Garda in the station yet is still free as a bird.

Lets assume you are right, someone just lied about thermite in that peer reviewed study, this still does not detract from the point that all the evidence suggests that some form on thermitic material was used and thus the official government conspiracy theory is a complete made up fantasy story ____ NIST claims that WTC 1 amp;2 collapsed due to jet fueled fires (just normal offices fires for WTC7) which were not hot enough to produce molten steel or iron, but also claim that if there had been molten steel or iron in the debris afterwards, it would have been irrelevant to the cause of the collapses. The evidence of molten steel or iron cannot be called irrelevant, given the fact that the building fires, as NIST pointed out, cannot explain it. ----------- **Physical Evidence** ----- * [Early in 2002, Barnett and two WPI colleagues published an analysis of a section of steel from one of the Twin Towers, along with sections from WTC 7, as an appendix to FEMAs 2002 World Trade Center Building Performance Study](http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf) * [Their discoveries were also reported in a WPI article entitled The Deep Mystery of Melted Steel, which said:](http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html) gt; Steel which has a melting point of 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit may weaken and bend, but does not melt during an ordinary office fire. Yet metallurgical studies on WTC steel brought back to WPI reveal that a novel phenomenon called a eutectic reaction occurred at the surface, causing intergranular melting capable of turning a solid steel girder into Swiss cheese. * [Stating that the New York Times called these findings perhaps the deepest mystery uncovered in the investigation, the article added:](http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html) gt;A one-inch column has been reduced to half-inch thickness.

"No, it's a reasonable question.

Noob here. When I started I was deadlifting 20kg (40 pounds) - about a quarter of my bodyweight. After some work and dedication I am now DLing 70kg (140 pounds) - slightly less than my body weight. Now, or at any stage of that process, if someone had told me to try DLing 160kg (320 pounds) I would have very seriously injured myself. That is not a mental blockage or lack of effort.

Like the young woman yesterday who had her best selling t-shirt design obviously and without doubt being printed and sold by Target. Redditors viciously attacked her, attacked the design as 'ugly' and 'unoriginal' (as if their fine sense of aesthetics mattered), attacked everyone selling on Etsy, attacked Etsy itself, claimed repeatedly that she didn't have a leg to stand on (when attorneys in the news articles that said she *did* have a case). Worst of all the top poster, doing the usual shitty job of playing reddit detective, claimed that she ripped off the Tootsie Roll Indian (on another shirt). That design is actually over 80 yrs old and has been in public domain for years. Despite this being pointed out, hundreds of neck bearded assholes jumped on the bandwagon, calling her a thief and worse. They were so horrible that she literally pulled that shirt from her store. This lady is supporting her kids from her screen printing operation in her garage. And these fuckwads attacked her - viciously. For what? Being female? Starting her own business? For doing more with her life than whacking it in moms basement? It was inexcusable and inexplicable. You would have thought half the commenters worked for Target. I am wondering if it ended up having a negative impact on her livelihood. I am just about fucking done.	like the young woman yesterday who had her best selling t shirt design obviously and without doubt being printed and sold by target redditors viciously attacked her attacked the design as ugly and unoriginal as if their fine sense of aesthetics mattered attacked everyone selling on etsy attacked etsy itself claimed repeatedly that she didn t have a leg to stand on when attorneys in the news articles that said she *did* have a case worst of all the top poster doing the usual shitty job of playing reddit detective claimed that she ripped off the tootsie roll indian on another shirt that design is actually over yrs old and has been in public domain for years despite this being pointed out hundreds of neck bearded assholes jumped on the bandwagon calling her a thief and worse they were so horrible that she literally pulled that shirt from her store this lady is supporting her kids from her screen printing operation in her garage and these attacked her viciously for what ? being female ? starting her own business ? for doing more with her life than whacking it in moms basement ? it was inexcusable and inexplicable you would have thought half the commenters worked for target i am wondering if it ended up having a negative impact on her livelihood i am just about fucking done 	-0.15	0.4281	228	0

There's probably some truth to that. My newer, closer friends all accept my NC as I'm pretty confident about it now, but when I was still LC with my step dad, I was confused and a little unsure about it. So I guess people probably picked up on that at the time, and people who weren't as close to me and didn't know the details would certainly misconstrue things and try to convince me to talk to him again. It also took me longer to recognize that my step dad was abusive, so when I told people why I was avoiding him at first I just said we disagreed about my NC with my brother. It wasn't until I realized that what my step dad was doing was abusive too and firmly decided on NC that my friends seemed to realize I was serious about it and the problem wasn't just one disagreement.

Really? If you use something like Airbnb you can get some pretty good accommodation for 45~ pounds a night, and if you pick the right place, a good host who is kind, and will answer any questions. If you eat out every day then, yes, like any other country it will be expensive, although granted it's still not 'cheap' if your making your own meals. Not sure what you mean by a nightmare traffic system? If you mean in terms of road congestion then you're going to find that in any large city you go to, not just London. With the mass transit you just need to use the replacement bus' services on weekends, otherwise AFAIK they're usually pretty good about keeping everything open in the week days. It's not like you won't be able to get somewhere just because they've blocked off a few tube stations. The people are welcoming when you get to know them. The stranger culture, on the other hand, is different than most American states, you won't find strangers being quite as cuddly towards each other. For the most part however, 99% of strangers i've encountered are kind and helpful. Just like any other large city. In terms of things 'to do', as well, there's pretty much an endless list of museums, places to visit, clubs to go to, beautiful architecture, etc etc etc.	really ? if you use something like airbnb you can get some pretty good accommodation for pounds a night and if you pick the right place a good host who is kind and will answer any questions if you eat out every day then yes like any other country it will be expensive although granted it s still not cheap if your making your own meals not sure what you mean by a nightmare traffic system ? if you mean in terms of road congestion then you re going to find that in any large city you go to not just london with the mass transit you just need to use the replacement bus services on weekends otherwise afaik they re usually pretty good about keeping everything open in the week days it s not like you won t be able to get somewhere just because they ve blocked off a few tube stations the people are welcoming when you get to know them the stranger culture on the other hand is different than most american states you won t find strangers being quite as cuddly towards each other for the most part however of strangers i ve encountered are kind and helpful just like any other large city in terms of things to do as well there s pretty much an endless list of museums places to visit clubs to go to beautiful architecture etc etc etc 	0.1779	0.328	238	0

Do any of you vent your anxieties to family or close friends? Since I started working on my anxiety I've noticed something about myself and was wondering if others have similar behaviour. I find I vent my anxieties to people close to me almost compulsively. It's such a weight off my shoulders to ask my family or friends, but sometimes I feel like I'm holding people hostage in conversations. I feel like I need to get some stuff off my chest and I don't know how else to go about it. I am seeing a therapist and I'm on medication, and while those have helped few things give the instant relief that talking to my parents or close friends give. I don't really like having this need, and I hate feeling like I'm pushing my problems on other people (its really selfish and self-involved). I also feel it makes me incredibly vulnerable and makes me seem weak. Do any of you experience the same thing? Do you have any suggestions to limit or completely stop the need to vent?	do any of you vent your anxieties to family or close friends ? since i started working on my anxiety i ve noticed something about myself and was wondering if others have similar behaviour i find i vent my anxieties to people close to me almost compulsively it s such a weight off my shoulders to ask my family or friends but sometimes i feel like i m holding people hostage in conversations i feel like i need to get some stuff off my chest and i don t know how else to go about it i am seeing a therapist and i m on medication and while those have helped few things give the instant relief that talking to my parents or close friends give i don t really like having this need and i hate feeling like i m pushing my problems on other people its really selfish and self involved i also feel it makes me incredibly vulnerable and makes me seem weak do any of you experience the same thing ? do you have any suggestions to limit or completely stop the need to vent ? 	-0.1833	0.3532	190	1

The States Attorneys Office conducted an independent investigation into this matter upon receiving notice of the incident. The charges with the respective maximum penalties are as follows: **Officer Caesar R. Goodson, Jr.** *[Driver of the wagon, checked on Gray several times but never restrained him or sought medical attention when Gray reported that he needed it, according to Mosby.]* 1. Second-degree depraved heart murder (30 yrs.) 2. Manslaughter (involuntary) (10 yrs.) 3. Assault/second-degree (gross negligence) (10 yrs.) 4. Manslaughter by vehicle criminal negligence (3 yrs.) 5. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*) **Officer William G. Porter** *[Asked Gray at one of the stops if he needed medical attention, according to Mosby. Porter assisted Gray onto a wagon bench, but didn't restrain him or get medical assistance.]* 1. Manslaughter (involuntary) (10 yrs.) 2. Assault/second-degree (10 yrs.) 3. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*) **Lt. Brian W. Rice** *[Bike patrol officer who first chased Gray, along with Nero and Miller, according to Mosby. Gray surrendered to them and they arrested him, even though they ""failed to establish probable cause"" for his arrest. Mosby said no crime had been committed and the knife that Gray was carrying was legal. Rice, Nero and Miller loaded Gray into the police wagon without restraining him; they later placed flex cuffs on his wrists and leg shackles on his ankles, placing him on his stomach, head first in the wagon, without a seatbelt.]* 1. Manslaughter (involuntary) (10 yrs.) 2. Assault/second-degree (10 yrs.) 3. Assault/second-degree (10 yrs.) 4. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*) 5. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*) 6. False imprisonment (8th Amendment*) **Officer Edward M. Nero** *[One of the three officers who pursued Gray. Nero and Miller handcuffed Gray and placed him in a prone position, according to Mosby. When they placed him in a seated position, they discovered a knife. Nero ""physically held him down against his will"" until a wagon arrived. Nero, along with Rice and Miller, loaded him into the wagon without restraining him; they later placed cuffs on his wrists and leg shackles on his ankles without a seatbelt.]* 1. Assault/second-degree (10 yrs.) 2. Assault/second-degree (10 yrs.) 3. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*) 4. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*) 5. False imprisonment (8th Amendment*) **Officer Garrett E. Miller** *[One of the three officers who pursued Gray, arrested and handcuffed him; Miller placed Gray in a restraining technique known as a ""leg lace,"" then was one of three officers who loaded him into the wagon without restraining him, according to Mosby.]* 1. Assault/second-degree (10 yrs.) 2. Assault/second-degree (10 yrs.) 3. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*) 4. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*) 5. False imprisonment (8th Amendment*) **Sgt. Alicia D. White** *[One of three officers who later found Gray unresponsive on the floor of the wagon, according to Mosby. White spoke to the back of his head, but when he didn't respond, she did nothing further ""despite the fact that she was advised that he needed a medic,"" Mosby said. ""She made no effort to look or assess or determine his condition. Despite Mr. Gray's seriously deteriorating medical condition, no medical assistance was rendered or summoned for Mr. Gray at that time by any officer.""]* 1. Manslaughter (involuntary) (10 yrs.) 2. Assault/second degree (10 yrs.) 3. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*) *Any sentence that does not constitute cruel unusual punishment. -### Edit: It's now online http://cdn.s3-media.wbal.com/Media/2015/05/01/4d07ceb1-3d55-4cb7-9b24-573638bd2cec/original.pdf **Video of Prosecutor Marilyn Mosby Press Conference** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfrVsq9h8U8 Thanks [/u/SaladAndEggs](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/34isvq/freddie_grays_death_ruled_a_homicide_by_states/cqv8aj6) for video link. **According to Prosecutor Marilyn Mosby, a knife, not switchblade, was found clipped to Gray's pants pocket;

Except that the best run subreddit communities are the ones that have mod-teams that enforce the rules and don't allow any hate-speech and other bullshit. For example, /r/Science does not allow bullshit opinions that aren't scientifically valid. Either as submissions or comments. So, they will ban you for creationism, anti-vaccine and [climate change denial](http://grist.org/climate-energy/reddits-science-forum-banned-climate-deniers-why-dont-all-newspapers-do-the-same/) as these are all views that are backed by all the world scientific community. In short, they want everyone to know that /r/Science is scientifically accurate. The same goes for other science based communties on Reddit such as /r/AskScience and /r/Biology. Likewise, /r/History and other history-based subredits like /r/HistoryPorn, /r/AskHistorians and /r/BadHistory don't allow history-denial. So, things like Holocaust denial, Lost Cause of the Confederacy propaganda, Ancient Aliens crap, Neo Nazis, White Supremacy and other total bullshit views will get you banned. There is a large problem with hate-based groups that are trying to *colonize* (their word) Reddit in the attempt to spread their views. Hate based groups like: White Supremacists, Neo Nazis, Skinheads, Holocaust Deniers, Extreme Misogynists, Racists who view all Muslims as terrorists, Extreme Racists, etc. It's a large number of groups, and there is a massive amount of overlap between these subgroups. These radical nuts run subreddits like /r/Holocaust (holocaust denial), /r/CoonTown, r/GreatApes, /r/European, /r/TheRedPill, /r/KotakuInAction, etc. Right now, [/r/CoonTown almost gets as much traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/coontown/about/traffic) as [stormfront.org](http://www.seethestats.com/site/stormfront.org). And that's not including the traffic from all the other racist shithole subreddits on the site. That spike in traffic is the Dylan Roof shooting, and the extra traffic seems to have staying power considering they picked up 4,000 subscribers in two days and another 1k at least since. If they don't take care of it soon, reddit will soon have the dubious honor of being the most active white supremacist forum on the the Internet. Hate Speech should not be a profit center for Reddit, or any other corporation. If the admins don't want to take the lead on this, then hopefully one or more [media outlets](http://gawker.com/so-long-reddit-1717315112) will start pick up on it and force the Admins to deal with it. /u/Spez's post here gives me hope that, at long last, the admins are finally going to do something about these groups.

I've got a couple for this: 1) One of the first times I ever did acid, I wound up driving myself home after everyone else started to pass out. I expected my roommate at the time to be asleep or at his lady friend's place. Such was not the case, and my roommate asked if I was on drugs or something (anti-drug fellow) I also had a lofted bed at the time so I just told him I was drunk, grabbed my pillow and blanket off my bed and slept on the floor. So there's my fail. 2) My success is basically everyday, between taking phone calls and planning arrangements drunk as fuck if I don't have to be somewhere or high as fuck if the day of the week ends in Y	i ve got a couple for this one of the first times i ever did acid i wound up driving myself home after everyone else started to pass out i expected my roommate at the time to be asleep or at his lady friend s place such was not the case and my roommate asked if i was on drugs or something anti drug fellow i also had a bed at the time so i just told him i was drunk grabbed my pillow and blanket off my bed and slept on the floor so there s my fail my success is basically everyday between taking phone calls and planning arrangements drunk as fuck if i don t have to be somewhere or high as fuck if the day of the week ends in y 	-0.1718	0.4265	135	1

I wish I could hug you. You were desperate and you felt like there was no way out. Guilt is a difficult thing to overcome, especially when you feel like it really was your fault. But despite what people say, it is possible to change. You can still hate what you did, but you don't have to hate yourself. You're human, and everyone makes mistakes. You're not the first person to have hurt other people and you won't be the last. I'm not saying to forget what you did, obviously it is something that is deeply bothering you. In fact if we just forget we don't really learn from the past. I'm saying to separate the act from the person you are. You can be a different person now and perform different actions. Also mistakes are a part of life. We all make mistakes. Some mistakes feel impossible to let go of. There are things that I deeply regret and if I had a chance I would go back and change it in an instant. But I can't. So the way forward for me is to try not to let it happen again. It may, but at least I will have done my best to try.	i wish i could hug you you were desperate and you felt like there was no way out guilt is a difficult thing to overcome especially when you feel like it really was your fault but despite what people say it is possible to change you can still hate what you did but you don t have to hate yourself you re human and everyone makes mistakes you re not the first person to have hurt other people and you won t be the last i m not saying to forget what you did obviously it is something that is deeply bothering you in fact if we just forget we don t really learn from the past i m saying to separate the act from the person you are you can be a different person now and perform different actions also mistakes are a part of life we all make mistakes some mistakes feel impossible to let go of there are things that i deeply regret and if i had a chance i would go back and change it in an instant but i can t so the way forward for me is to try not to let it happen again it may but at least i will have done my best to try 	-0.104	0.5327	214	1

We Australians really don't have any big international pop culture icons at all. But Mad Max was different. Mad Max was revolutionary, and has gone down in pop culture history. All current post apocalyptic fiction is based in some way on Mad Max. Mad Max was our culture's biggest contribution to the larger pop culture universe. And to just ignore a huge part of the character and fiction is just so pointless and silly. Why take away such an important aspect of Mad Max to just make him a typical gravelly voiced American protagonist?

How often do you change your underwear? How often do you wash them? Underwear means panties, bras, and socks in this case. I only wear underwear for one day. Every so often I change them twice a day.

"Dial-Up // Part 3 [Part 1](http://redd.it/2bqjb8) // [Part 2](http://redd.it/2bvr8p) --- ""Sam, look. I've seen Breaking Bad, okay? I know that this money has to be laundered or hidden or whatever. What good is it going to do except prove that I knew about this?"" ""The money's legal."" ""So that's why you told me to leave my house? Why we're hiding out in a closed donut shop?"" ""Look, I brought you in because I think you deserve to know what's going on. That's also why I cut you in on it when the others told me not to."" ""Cut the bullshit. What did you get into and how deep am I in it?"" ""Remember when I said that I'd do anything to have connection speed like yours? That wasn't some hypothetical 'ask Santa' wish. I already had big plans for it. More than just the Bitcoin mining pools I told you about. Those brought in some initial capital, but the big fish lied in investment transactions."" ""You're speaking in code."" ""The stock market. It's called low latency, high volume trading, and it normally requires some very specific hardware."" He could see the blank look on my face creeping back. ""Big computers that can tell when a stock is bought or sold, and can buy or sell on its own at pre-set price points."" ""So you legally got all this money from the stock market?"" ""Yes. It may be frowned upon, but it's new enough that there aren't any rules against it, or against how you do it. With a fast enough connection and enough computing power, you can drop latency to under a millisecond. Nobody's ever done that before."" ""So what? You're not a stock market whiz kid."" ""Right. That's why I brought in... my friend. He lives in New York and he *is* a 'whiz kid.'"" ""Friend,"" I made air-quotes with my fingers. Sam pretended not to see them. ""He knew the systems and strategies of the big big investment companies well enough to make improvements, but he was ultimately under-appreciated and ignored. I offered him a sandbox, with all the tools he needed to invent his own system."" ""So... What went wrong?"" ""Nothing."" ""Nothing?"" ""It worked great. We've made lots of money haven't we? And it's only been a week."" ""What the fuck, Sam? I thought someone was coming for me."" ""Right... Well... That's..."" I could tell that he didn't want to tell me what was coming. He bit his lip and leaned back in his chair. ""Somebody knows about us. I mean, we're a small target a long ways away from them, but somebody's not happy about it."" ""They think we stole their money,"" came a voice from behind the glass display case. A man in a disheveled blue button-up shirt with dirty blond hair, and a blazer that failed to close over his gut stood up and took a bite of a pink donut. ""Fucking hypocritical of them, but that's what they say, anyway."" ""Friends of yours?"" I asked the owner of the new voice. ""Not anymore,"" he shrugged. ""So these are what, like hit men? Are they the mob?"" His laughter echoed around the room. I could hear the nights of booze and smoke that had settled into his lungs. I disliked him instantly for his obtuseness. ""The fucking *mob.* Who is this guy? I think I like him."" When the other men didn't laugh at his theatrics, he turned back to me. ""Okay look, Junior. There's no mob, there's no hit man. There's no Boogey man or Santa Claus either. What we have here is an entitled asshole who just lost his investors a few million big ones."" ""To us."" ""To us. Which shouldn't include you if you couldn't fucking figure that out already."" ""So what, he's going to steal it back?"" ""No."" The donut man said nonchalantly. ""Nah - he just wants to kill us."" ""KIll *you*, you mean?"" I jabbed back. I saw Sam flinch a little as I said it, but as I saw it, he was as much at fault as this clown standing in front of me. I expected him to respond, but he only looked at Sam. ""Tell him! You're the one who wanted to bring him here."" ""I'm sorry, man. It's your name on the bill for the internet connection. I still don't know how it happened, but whatever you got wasn't intended for you, and it didn't come out of nowhere either. Somebody spent big money for it. And now they want it back."" ""So I'll just cancel it. I'll turn it off - they can have it. I don't give a fuck, I didn't ask for this."" ""Whoah, there slugger,"" said the man in the blazer. I stood and looked down at Sam. ""Sam, I'm getting out of this. I'm turning it off."" ""You can't."" I felt, rather than heard two men move in front of the doors behind me. Sam looked up, his gaze piercing into me. ""You can't turn off the connection until we're done."" ""What do you mean 'when you're done?' No way! Sam! Stop this!"" ""You're going to go away for a while. It's just easier this way. At the end of the month you can come back. You can have your cut. Honestly, it's for the best, this way."" The man in the blazer clapped and pointed at the tho men blocking the doors. ""Alright then.

Not to be pedantic, but the FCC is an agency, not a committee. Agencies have the power to regulate in the field delegated to them by Congress, but statutes trump regulations. Agencies get to interpret statutes and their interpretation of vague statutes is generally deferred to by the courts, but if the statute is clear, it is what it is. So yes, Congress can certainly pass legislation that would ensure net neutrality. Would they?

Right, it's insane. As motorcyclists who travel between traffic in California we deal with a greater number of individuals per day than almost any other commuter out there. This means our chances of dealing with one of those insane people goes up. Which means you either accept that the person you're telling to get off the fucking phone is insane and might take your valuable advice the wrong way, or you swallow it and move on with your life. The choice is yours, just know that this crazy motherfucker, and other's like him are out there on the road.	right it s insane as motorcyclists who travel between traffic in california we deal with a greater number of individuals per day than almost any other commuter out there this means our chances of dealing with one of those insane people goes up which means you either accept that the person you re telling to get off the fucking phone is insane and might take your valuable advice the wrong way or you swallow it and move on with your life the choice is yours just know that this crazy motherfucker and other s like him are out there on the road 	-0.4164	0.368	102	0
I don't know why but when I saw this happen I distinctly remember not caring either way. I think I am now apathetic to people's transport woes. But now I've had a chance to think about it, I suppose I think they're stupid trying to take on a bus - I mean what if the driver doesn't see them? Why is their time frame more important than people on the bus? On the other hand, why are bus drivers assholes sometimes and why do they go out of their way not to pick up passengers? Why are buses so damn unreliable and instead of just working to a schedule, why do 3 buses come at once? Why is it when I submitted complaint forms about the buses all coming at once they tell me that it's because of traffic, but how could they all arrive at once in traffic? Wouldn't they have to have still left the same time to be at the same point in the traffic to arrive at the exact same time? I don't even know where to direct my frustration anymore, I'm so frustrated with the whole bus system and all the passengers have gone crazy including me!!!	i don t know why but when i saw this happen i distinctly remember not caring either way i think i am now apathetic to people s transport woes but now i ve had a chance to think about it i suppose i think they re stupid trying to take on a bus i mean what if the driver doesn t see them ? why is their time frame more important than people on the bus ? on the other hand why are bus drivers assholes sometimes and why do they go out of their way not to pick up passengers ? why are buses so damn unreliable and instead of just working to a schedule why do buses come at once ? why is it when i submitted complaint forms about the buses all coming at once they tell me that it s because of traffic but how could they all arrive at once in traffic ? wouldn t they have to have still left the same time to be at the same point in the traffic to arrive at the exact same time ? i don t even know where to direct my frustration anymore i m so frustrated with the whole bus system and all the passengers have gone crazy including me ! ! ! 	-0.093	0.4197	218	1

Vladimir is incredibly weak to all-ins early game. Pretty much anyone that can jump on him and stick (Irelia, Xin are good examples) can wreck him and zone him away. He'll be forced to cs with his Q instead of poking you, and if he ever gets in range to Q you, he's convienetly in range to get jumped on and eat a full rotation. On someone like Maokai it's a lot tougher, as you don't have the early damage to really break through his sustain. I'd reccomend just using the bushes the best you can so you don't eat free poke. He's also really vulnerable to ganks, and Maokai is amazing at setting them up, so let him push up a bit and get your jungler to come. Also, possibly one of the hardest counters in the game is picking fiddlesticks against vlad.

They aren't inaccessible. It's just that one their own, they lack popular front-end frameworks to rapid prototype an application that you can use. I think if you are learning programming for the first time, especially outside of a college environment - it's really fulfilling when you can build a real live application that solves an itch you have and is fun to use. That can be a huge high that leads you to build on the skill and get better. It's a little bit like learning a musical instrument for the first time. If you spend the first 6 months just playing scales back and forth, it gets dull and people tend to lose interest, but the minute you learn that first tune, you are hooked. Suddenly you aren't playing an instrument, you are making music that you recognize as music. The same goes with programming. The sooner you move away from learning coding, and start to build something you can play with, you get hooked. Python and C++ are fantastic programs. I especially loved C++. Maybe with something like C++, you could learn openGL / Unity / Unreal and make a cool game or something. I used to enjoy using C++ for image processing (but I admit it was because of a class I took and not self driven). Perhaps you are exceptionally curious and driven and use those languages to build out something amazing. With Python - you could even use learn Django and end up making a cool web app. But if you are starting out coding in your 20s, then start with PHP / Yii and build a simple blog. Then figure out how to integrate it with or extend Wordpress, and add little features and hooks. If you do that, programming ceases to be a series of obscure incantations that you offer up to a computing black box, and suddenly becomes the lego building blocks to a new and tangible universe.	they aren t inaccessible it s just that one their own they lack popular front end frameworks to rapid prototype an application that you can use i think if you are learning programming for the first time especially outside of a college environment it s really fulfilling when you can build a real live application that solves an itch you have and is fun to use that can be a huge high that leads you to build on the skill and get better it s a little bit like learning a musical instrument for the first time if you spend the first months just playing scales back and forth it gets dull and people tend to lose interest but the minute you learn that first tune you are hooked suddenly you aren t playing an instrument you are making music that you recognize as music the same goes with programming the sooner you move away from learning coding and start to build something you can play with you get hooked python and c are fantastic programs i especially loved c maybe with something like c you could learn opengl unity unreal and make a cool game or something i used to enjoy using c for image processing but i admit it was because of a class i took and not self driven perhaps you are exceptionally curious and driven and use those languages to build out something amazing with python you could even use learn django and end up making a cool web app but if you are starting out coding in your s then start with php and build a simple blog then figure out how to integrate it with or extend wordpress and add little features and hooks if you do that programming ceases to be a series of obscure that you offer up to a computing black box and suddenly becomes the lego building blocks to a new and tangible universe 	0.1778	0.194	324	0

"Meds won't help with apnea, and in fact will probably make it worse if it causes you to relax more. Because alcohol makes apnea worse for the same reasons. Sleeping on your side can SOMETIMES help. You should get treated because untreated apneas have long term health problems for your heart, blood pressure, etc due to your BP spiking each and everytime you ""choke"" and then dropping when you wake, and repeating all night long whether you remember waking up or not. They used to treat apnea prior to the machines by giving people tracheotomies. Which is basically cutting a hole in your neck and letting you breath through that hole to avoid the potential blockage area altogether. Weight loss can help alleviate sleep apnea, but it will probably return with age due to slackening of skin/muscles."	meds won t help with apnea and in fact will probably make it worse if it causes you to relax more because alcohol makes apnea worse for the same reasons sleeping on your side can sometimes help you should get treated because untreated have long term health problems for your heart blood pressure etc due to your bp spiking each and everytime you choke and then dropping when you wake and repeating all night long whether you remember waking up or not they used to treat apnea prior to the machines by giving people which is basically cutting a hole in your neck and letting you breath through that hole to avoid the potential blockage area altogether weight loss can help alleviate sleep apnea but it will probably return with age due to of skin muscles 	-0.1136	0.4164	136	1

You're too attached to the idea that science is the only valid approach to consider the logical foundations of that idea and their flaws. Religion, here, is only an example to show errors in your reasoning. You don't know whether I agree or disagree with you about any particular application of science or religion; I didn't claim that religion is better or worse for anything. I did attempt to show how your logic can go either way (and is therefore questionable). It's no good for science when it becomes a dogma, a collection of other people's beliefs for you to accept or reject on the basis of ordinary thinking, without critical examination. Science grew hand in hand with analytic philosophy for good reason - it *requires* rigorous logical examination to remain science.	you re too attached to the idea that science is the only valid approach to consider the logical foundations of that idea and their flaws religion here is only an example to show errors in your reasoning you don t know whether i agree or disagree with you about any particular application of science or religion i didn t claim that religion is better or worse for anything i did attempt to show how your logic can go either way and is therefore questionable it s no good for science when it becomes a dogma a collection of other people s beliefs for you to accept or reject on the basis of ordinary thinking without critical examination science grew hand in hand with analytic philosophy for good reason it rigorous logical examination to remain science 	0.0186	0.5	135	0

Why waste time on old stories when you've got a slew of new skills and experiences at your disposal and you could just create something new? For the same reason we renovate homes instead of building new ones: it creates jobs which, in turn, helps the economy grow. DO YOU HATE THE ECONOMY, KNEEOD?! No, no wait. That definitely doesn't make sense. Let me try again. Because it keeps away the termites? Yeah. That's the reason. Termites. Let's keep them away. (I can see the benefit of wanting to rework a story. Sometimes, you love the idea, but hate how it was applied, and want another kick at the can. I'd be inclined to go back and fix some of my stories if/when I release an anthology. 'Cause the formatting on some of my earlier ones makes my eyes bleed. And some of them weren't up to par. And termites.

Seriously you never heard of the yes does not mean yes campaign? seriously i have a friend in the uk, feminist was telling me rape laws were not inclusive and they need to add more definitions like how being coerced into sex(if your partner badgers you but you don't feel like it, his continued persistence even if you're reluctant) should be considered a form of sexual assault, how regret should be considered valid. In false accusations should be punished extensively, you can't declare rape is a serious crime and then allow the false reporting of rape to continue, you're making a mockery of rape, you're basically saying rape is the worse crime a woman can endure but it's perfectly fine if another woman lies about rape and deliberately hurting how actual rapes will be treated in the future, has no one ever read a boy cried wolf, same concept applies.	i love this lets ignore the statement and then ask who is saying this if i have never heard of it your point is invalid seriously you never heard of the yes does not mean yes campaign ? seriously i have a friend in the uk feminist was telling me rape laws were not inclusive and they need to add more definitions like how being coerced into sex if your partner badgers you but you don t feel like it his continued persistence even if you re reluctant should be considered a form of sexual assault how regret should be considered valid in false accusations should be punished extensively you can t declare rape is a serious crime and then allow the false reporting of rape to continue you re making a mockery of rape you re basically saying rape is the worse crime a woman can endure but it s perfectly fine if another woman lies about rape and deliberately hurting how actual rapes will be treated in the future has no one ever read a boy cried wolf same concept applies 	-0.0085	0.711	183	0

(110x109x108x107x106)/(5x4x3x2x1) = 122,391,522 (110x109x108x107x106x105x104x103x102x101)/(10x9x8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1) = 4,689,764 (rounded up from a decimal).	if you re talking strictly on team i believe it comes out to possible combinations for both teams you re looking at math done using the formula for finding the amount of combinations of card hands possible in a card deck n k n n n k k k where n is total amount of cards heroes in our case and k is the number of combinations you re trying to find rounded up from a decimal 	-0.3	0.228	77	1

Okay, but my question is, when their attempts to achieve a goal of promoting free speech in universities accidentally supports hateful people...is that a goal worth achieving, at least in the way they're doing it? Yes. Bigots exist in this world, we both know it. Should we shelter college students from that fact? Should we shelter them in how to deal with hard, important discussions about race, gender, history, religion and so on? Colleges are supposed to be a market place of ideas where discussions of all types are had so students can learn and proposer. Hate speech already has a strict, Constitutional definition, and often colleges might not follow through with adhering to what SCOTUS has ruled. Banning speech, in the *very* place it's supposed to be most free, is problematic.	okay but my question is when their attempts to achieve a goal of promoting free speech in universities accidentally supports hateful people is that a goal worth achieving at least in the way they re doing it ? yes bigots exist in this world we both know it should we shelter college students from that fact ? should we shelter them in how to deal with hard important discussions about race gender history religion and so on ? colleges are supposed to be a market place of ideas where discussions of all types are had so students can learn and hate speech already has a strict constitutional definition and often colleges might not follow through with adhering to what scotus has ruled banning speech in the *very* place it s supposed to be most free is problematic 	0.1308	0.6155	137	0
"27/M/5'9"" SW: 285 CW: 241 GW: 198. 4 months in, 44 pounds down! I'm officially half way to onderland! (PROGRESS PICS!) Hey guys, I've been holding off on progress pics for a while now because I don't really see that much of a change in them (my clothes are all practically falling off, it's just the side by side which doesn't seem that much different). Either way, 4 months in and I'm finally over the half way point for onderland. Still very much going strong. Thanks for all of your help my friends. My next progress post will be in onederland I hope :D For the sake of clarity, I've been on a 1800-2000 guestimation calorie diet (not counting calories religiously, I just have a general idea of how much is in my food and I budget around it), I'm losing around about 2 lbs per week and as I'm edging closer I'm adjusting my diet ever so slightly. I do cardio at the gym 2-4 times a week. It was previously 45 minutes of fast walking with intermittent jogging bouts. But now I've worked my way up to 30 minute session which is 5 minute warm up walk, 20 minute solid jog and 5 minute cooldown. Which is actually one of my goals! **Hooray for NSVs**. I know there are a lot of people at /r/loseit who are really close to my stats. **Keep at it**, trust me. You'll wish you'd started earlier. I know I do :) Thanks for being awesome guys.

The dream thing is a completely different flavor of fucked up. That's not what little girls should have going on. The dream though actually reminds me of something I heard later on though. I think it was about people in east Germany that lived near the Berlin Wall. The men would begin to dig a hole to tunnel under so they could escape with their families. But they couldn't just have big dirt piles laying around. So every day they would fill their lunch boxes with dirt and dump it at work. Which would end up taking years.

"So, what are the odds I'm insane? I've whispered to myself for years. It's usually the last few words of a sentence I've just said. For instance, I might tell my dad about something that happened during the day. Let's say my story ended with,""So then, he finally left!"" For about thirty seconds, I'll whisper under my breath, ""He finally left, he finally left,"" until something else catches my attention or someone brings up that I'm whispering to myself again. Sometimes if I think of something in my head, like, ""Oh yeah, I have to feed the dog,"" I'll whisper, ""Feed the dog, feed the dog,"" over and over without even realizing it. But sometimes, I will whisper things that I haven't even thought of. This morning, I was sitting while putting my shoes on and thinking about a movie I wanted to watch. My sister says, ""You know, that's creepy."" ""What's creepy?"" ""You whispering over and over again that dad told you to let the dog out."" The scary thing? Dad had said no such thing to me. He was still in bed. I wasn't even thinking of the dog. What's even more concerning is that it's happening more frequently. I'll whisper things no one said; things I'm not even thinking about. Maybe soon it'll be on the news that I've killed my family with a steak knife while maniacally repeating the lyrics to a song."	so what are the odds i m insane ? i ve whispered to myself for years it s usually the last few words of a sentence i ve just said for instance i might tell my dad about something that happened during the day let s say my story ended with so then he finally left ! for about thirty seconds i ll whisper under my breath he finally left he finally left until something else catches my attention or someone brings up that i m whispering to myself again sometimes if i think of something in my head like oh yeah i have to feed the dog i ll whisper feed the dog feed the dog over and over without even realizing it but sometimes i will whisper things that i haven t even thought of this morning i was sitting while putting my shoes on and thinking about a movie i wanted to watch my sister says you know that s creepy what s creepy ? you whispering over and over again that dad told you to let the dog out the scary thing ? dad had said no such thing to me he was still in bed i wasn t even thinking of the dog what s even more concerning is that it s happening more frequently i ll whisper things no one said things i m not even thinking about maybe soon it ll be on the news that i ve killed my family with a steak knife while maniacally repeating the lyrics to a song 	-0.1367	0.234	260	1

"Ok, I am female. I don't talk about it much but I have in the past been in an abusive relationship. I could not give less of a shit about who suffers the most out of men or women from domestic violence, I just want it to stop and for people to feel like they can get the help they need or the knowledge to recognise if they are with an abusive partner. Those types of posts piss me off so much because it's obvious that these people want so badly to be able to say ""AHA! See?! We men do actually have it worse, so shut up, every woman ever who's complaining about domestic violence!"". It's not about saying ""aww shit, domestic violence has been misrepresented as a women's-only issue, maybe let's do some constructive shit about highlighting the needs of victims in general or something constructive-"" NOPE. It's about them being able to say ""YEAH women are just evil evil evil and want the world to believe that they are victims! Fuck them, amirite?"". GAH. It helps no one! Why can't people just genuinely care about other people without having some hateful us vs. them agenda and dear God I need to go lie down or something... /rant. Edit: this isn't to say that I can't see why this sort of mentality exists. Imagine you are a dude who maybe feels a bit insecure and unsure about certain social issues and other aspects of life.

If someone wants a gun and is willing to obtain it illegally, they will obtain one. Just look at Chicago, 16 year olds have all the guns they need. Laws only restrict the law abiding. You also must remember the 2nd amendment to the US constitution. The restrictions you mention are not enumerated by the Constitution. A few restrictions have been allowed but they are almost entirely as a result of John Dillinger and other prohibition era gangsters and the 1968 gun act. Further restrictions will be resisted by those, including myself, who view them as a violation of constitutional law. If you want to have guns restricted then you must change the constitution first. The constitution specifically ensured the people would be armed to act as a check and balance against government oppression and allow the people to revolt if necessary. As a result, most gun owners are against giving up their guns or restricting their ownership based on our natural rights	if someone wants a gun and is willing to obtain it illegally they will obtain one just look at chicago year olds have all the guns they need laws only restrict the law abiding you also must remember the nd amendment to the us constitution the restrictions you mention are not enumerated by the constitution a few restrictions have been allowed but they are almost entirely as a result of john dillinger and other prohibition era gangsters and the gun act further restrictions will be resisted by those including myself who view them as a violation of constitutional law if you want to have guns restricted then you must change the constitution first the constitution specifically ensured the people would be armed to act as a check and balance against government oppression and allow the people to revolt if necessary as a result most gun owners are against giving up their guns or restricting their ownership based on our natural rights 	0.0365	0.555	161	0

I too am an aspiring writer from a country where English is not the official language, India.. Luckily enough, I was able to pursue all my education in English medium all along.. Ok, now coming to the *Writing* part. To write a well is an art. And to create art, you ought to be *inspired..* As you're saying that you're interested in writing, I would suggest you to recognize the kind of writing that inspires you... You should take it from the very basic level.. *Start reading quotes*, lots of quotes from lots of authors.. And I'm sure that will inspire you.. and then alongside, think back into your own past experiences that you feel are vital for your life, and try writing small quotes/sentences about them, whatever they would be, just write a sentence about it. Once you start doing this regularly, you will not only feel like writing more of them, but you will also unconsciously strive to write them more beautifully.. That's how you start recognizing the preciousness of the **art** that you possess. And once you do that, you will automatically get to know what more to do to improve your style, flow and simplicity in putting the words together.. When you're well into such process, you will eventually build up confidence and you will know what would be the purpose of your writing. This is what I learned by practicing writing since past 4 years.. I started with writing blogs (began with Blogger, and after all this time, recently switched to Medium.com).. At the begining, my writings had lots of grammatical errors, but after all these years, I'm able to write better, with very less grammatical errors, and above all, with a more inspired spirit in my writing. *Note*: Read more. Once when you start reading quotes from the books, and when you stumble upon a really really really grand quote or sentence, sit back and think what would've resulted somebody in writing such a sentence.. and then try to read the book which the quote came from... This way you will understand the context behind beautiful words and sentences and believe me, you will desire to create such onces youself. Even after doing all this, if your skill or ability as a writer doesn't change or advance, tell me, I will give you my address.. you can come and kill me!	i too am an aspiring writer from a country where english is not the official language india luckily enough i was able to pursue all my education in english medium all along ok now coming to the part to write a well is an art and to create art you ought to be inspired as you re saying that you re interested in writing i would suggest you to recognize the kind of writing that inspires you you should take it from the very basic level start reading quotes lots of quotes from lots of authors and i m sure that will inspire you and then alongside think back into your own past experiences that you feel are vital for your life and try writing small quotes sentences about them whatever they would be just write a sentence about it once you start doing this regularly you will not only feel like writing more of them but you will also unconsciously strive to write them more beautifully that s how you start recognizing the of the that you possess and once you do that you will automatically get to know what more to do to improve your style flow and simplicity in putting the words together when you re well into such process you will eventually build up confidence and you will know what would be the purpose of your writing this is what i learned by practicing writing since past years i started with writing blogs began with blogger and after all this time recently switched to medium com at the begining my writings had lots of grammatical errors but after all these years i m able to write better with very less grammatical errors and above all with a more inspired spirit in my writing *note* read more once when you start reading quotes from the books and when you stumble upon a really really really grand quote or sentence sit back and think what would ve resulted somebody in writing such a sentence and then try to read the book which the quote came from this way you will understand the context behind beautiful words and sentences and believe me you will desire to create such even after doing all this if your skill or ability as a writer doesn t change or advance tell me i will give you my address you can come and kill me ! 	0.2037	0.2304	402	0

You fail to understand that it's not because the Grand Jury and the general public have access to the same information that said information is the cold hard truth. Judges are not Gods. They are humans presented with evidences made by humans, some false, some true. They do not know more than you and I do. Their job is not really to find the truth since it's impossible, their job is to take what they have and guess what happened, to punish accordingly. It is why sometimes murderers can get away with murder: if there is no evidence (even if everyone knows in their guts he did it), the judge cannot put the guy in prison. No one knows shit. We were not here. Only witnesses, Wilson and Brown know what you truly. So stop speculating, and stop using this situation to be racist.	you fail to understand that it s not because the grand jury and the general public have access to the same information that said information is the cold hard truth judges are not gods they are humans presented with made by humans some false some true they do not know more than you and i do their job is not really to find the truth since it s impossible their job is to take what they have and guess what happened to punish accordingly it is why sometimes murderers can get away with murder if there is no evidence even if everyone knows in their guts he did it the judge cannot put the guy in prison no one knows shit we were not here only witnesses wilson and brown know what you truly so stop speculating and stop using this situation to be racist 	-0.097	0.5275	145	1
This is a clear violation of the FLSA. Even if you weren't missing work for military service, as long as you work or attempt to work 40 hours a week, your employer must pay you your full salary for that week. It's important for your employer to understand the potential downsides of what they're doing. Exempt refers to an exemption from regular hourly pay and overtime rules. If they violate the specific rules for exempt employees, they lose that exemption. That means that they must pay you overtime for all the hours you work over 40 in a week. And this can be applied retroactively. Which means you can sue them for back pay for every hour you've worked over 40 in a week going back to the time you were hired.	this is a clear violation of the flsa even if you weren t missing work for military service as long as you work or attempt to work hours a week your employer must pay you your full salary for that week it s important for your employer to understand the potential downsides of what they re doing exempt refers to an exemption from regular hourly pay and overtime rules if they violate the specific rules for exempt employees they lose that exemption that means that they must pay you overtime for all the hours you work over in a week and this can be applied retroactively which means you can sue them for back pay for every hour you ve worked over in a week going back to the time you were hired 	0.0455	0.535	133	0

"Sure, [Wikiquote says this is from](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Smedley_Butler) a 1935 socialist newspaper ""Common Sense."" Butler is a fascinating but almost forgotten hero from American history. Most Americans recall Congress' ""House Un-American Activities Committe"" as being the platform for Joe McCarthy's anti-communist witch-hunt during the 50s, or the 1960s when Vietnam anti-war protesters called in front of the HUAC mocked the entire proceeding and made a laughingstock out of the HUAC. But the HUAC was founded in the 1930s to investigate the fascist coup d'etat which Butler blew the whistle on. Being a popular and highly decorated general, Butler was approached by a group of industrialists who wanted to overthrow the US government, create a fascist government and to put him in charge as their figurehead (the so-called ""Business Plot""). But Butler informed the Roosevelt administration about the traitors and caused FDR allies in Congress to start the HUAC. Butler's famous short book ""War is a Racket"" should be required reading, but few have ever heard of it. Today, the US Marine Corps issues out a suggested reading list of famous Marines to indoctrinate young Marines in training about the heritage and valor of the USMC. Despite Butler being 1 of the 2 most highest decorated Marines, needless to say Butler is not on the Corps' suggested reading list."	sure says this is from a socialist newspaper common sense butler is a fascinating but almost forgotten hero from american history most americans recall congress house un american activities committe as being the platform for joe mccarthy s anti communist witch hunt during the s or the s when vietnam anti war protesters called in front of the huac mocked the entire proceeding and made a out of the huac but the huac was founded in the s to investigate the fascist coup d etat which butler blew the whistle on being a popular and highly decorated general butler was approached by a group of industrialists who wanted to overthrow the us government create a fascist government and to put him in charge as their figurehead the so called business plot but butler informed the roosevelt administration about the traitors and caused fdr allies in congress to start the huac butler s famous short book war is a racket should be required reading but few have ever heard of it today the us marine corps issues out a suggested reading list of famous marines to young marines in training about the heritage and valor of the usmc despite butler being of the most highest decorated marines needless to say butler is not on the corps suggested reading list 	0.1944	0.3275	218	0

I always go down on my SO and rub her clit (quite often at the same time) and/or include G-spot stim with two fingers BEFORE we go anywhere near intercourse. After two/three goes (sometimes she works her clit for me), we switch up and we have sex. Occasionally she'll orgasm from this penetration but only after cumming the other way first. This wasn't always the case- she faked it for a long while at the start of our relationship, but once she had owned up (she was hesitant to tell me that she only ever came through clit stim usually), she taught me how she usually did it, and viola! Satisfaction every time.

I used to do both because I thought one shower a day was nasty, then I became lazy and showered in the morning only because I thought not showering before leaving the house was nasty, but then lately I've been showering at night ... Because I want an extra hour of sleep. I really can't fall asleep early, so I rather shower immediately before bed (midnight) so I can wake up at 7 instead of 6 or 6:30. However I work 'at home', so whatever. If I have to go outside, I still shower beforehand. Btw when I say nasty, I mean I would be nasty if I did it. I used to sweat a lot, and not showering twice a day meant hell until I found a good deo, and since it's still cold and I don't sweat at night anymore, I wake up smelling fresh now. Very happy.	i used to do both because i thought one shower a day was nasty then i became lazy and showered in the morning only because i thought not showering before leaving the house was nasty but then lately i ve been showering at night because i want an extra hour of sleep i really can t fall asleep early so i rather shower immediately before bed midnight so i can wake up at instead of or however i work at home so whatever if i have to go outside i still shower beforehand btw when i say nasty i mean i would be nasty if i did it i used to sweat a lot and not showering twice a day meant hell until i found a good deo and since it s still cold and i don t sweat at night anymore i wake up smelling fresh now very happy 	-0.1977	0.4385	150	1

Personally I see this tension as the core of the issue. There are groups that want to view marriage as a purely religious construct and therefore their rejection of LGBQT marriage or anything associated with it is a matter of personal freedom of choice and therefore protected - but that simply isn't the case and it hasn't been for a very long time because of the depth of legal status of marriage in national and international law. Attempting to limit access to marriage denies fundamental freedoms to LGBQT people - freedoms so fundamental that most people barely think of them or realise that they're even there until they don't have them. Ultimately everyone is free to accept or reject LGBQT marriage in their personal lives, but they don't' have the right to impose their beliefs on other people in society and thereby limit other's freedoms for no good reason. Why wouldn't a baker, for example, that doesn't wish to service LGBQT couples simply put a sign in their shop window to that effect? This would save everyone embarrassment! The reason is that they know that such a sign would hurt their business even among the straight community - in other words they *know* that there is a difference between their personal beliefs and the functionality of their work. On the company issue, I don't have a problem with your position and I don't think it's bigoted, but I do think it's unrealistic. Can we really live in a society where the personal religious views of a company's CEO affect *your* partner's ability to receive part of *your* pension should you die? Equally if that is the standard then why couldn't a company turn around and refuse to pay survivor benefits to anyone regardless of their sexuality - these things cut both ways.	personally i see this tension as the core of the issue there are groups that want to view marriage as a purely religious construct and therefore their rejection of lgbqt marriage or anything associated with it is a matter of personal freedom of choice and therefore protected but that simply isn t the case and it hasn t been for a very long time because of the depth of legal status of marriage in national and international law attempting to limit access to marriage denies fundamental freedoms to lgbqt people freedoms so fundamental that most people barely think of them or realise that they re even there until they don t have them ultimately everyone is free to accept or reject lgbqt marriage in their personal lives but they don t have the right to impose their beliefs on other people in society and thereby limit other s freedoms for no good reason why wouldn t a baker for example that doesn t wish to service lgbqt couples simply put a sign in their shop window to that effect ? this would save everyone embarrassment ! the reason is that they know that such a sign would hurt their business even among the straight community in other words they *know* that there is a difference between their personal beliefs and the functionality of their work on the company issue i don t have a problem with your position and i don t think it s bigoted but i do think it s unrealistic can we really live in a society where the personal religious views of a company s ceo affect *your* partner s ability to receive part of *your* pension should you die ? equally if that is the standard then why couldn t a company turn around and refuse to pay survivor benefits to anyone regardless of their sexuality these things cut both ways 	0.0179	0.5119	316	0

I recommend that you just start doing small things by yourself that give you room to breathe. I volunteer with a hospice on the weekend, and my assignments require me to drive for an hour both ways to see my ladies. This time by myself in the car with music I like to listen to greatly quells my wanderlust. A lot of the things that you've mentioned aren't really things that you can simply go out and do without there being some damage, but you know, I said to my husband (who is a major homebody and allergic to spending money) that I wanted to travel when our daughter was older. I told him that I would love for him to come, but that if he didn't, I still needed to go. I think a lot of young people go into marriage thinking that it means you'll do things together all the time, but the truth is that you might not ever do a thing if you wait for the other person to participate. It's okay to do things alone! It makes you feel capable and smart and free.	i recommend that you just start doing small things by yourself that give you room to breathe i volunteer with a hospice on the weekend and my assignments require me to drive for an hour both ways to see my ladies this time by myself in the car with music i like to listen to greatly my wanderlust a lot of the things that you ve mentioned aren t really things that you can simply go out and do without there being some damage but you know i said to my husband who is a major and allergic to spending money that i wanted to travel when our daughter was older i told him that i would love for him to come but that if he didn t i still needed to go i think a lot of young people go into marriage thinking that it means you ll do things together all the time but the truth is that you might not ever do a thing if you wait for the other person to participate it s okay to do things alone ! it makes you feel capable and smart and free 	0.2226	0.4264	193	0

Monday's are Mexican nights at Tom Bergin's Irish pub Excited to check it out since its re-opening, and figuring they have all the kinks worked out by now; me and the SO went to Tom's this evening. It was disappointing. :-( The food was OK, but not as good as either of us remembered it. We both got the staple fish and chips, but were not pleased by the end of the meal. The fish is a different style cut, and the batter just didn't seem the same. Also, the chips (really skinny fries), while tasting quite good to start-off, turned out to be overly salty. The special Mexican-Monday menu was a bit off-putting. Dont get me wrong, I like Mexican food - but I went to an Irish pub to get, food/drink specific to an Irish pub. Thankfully, fish and chips are always on the menu regardless. edit for clarity: The menu is 90%+ mexican food on Monday's only.

My (20f) brother (18m) decided to buy paint and paint my parents' (60m/58f) kitchen without asking. It looks like a crack den and he has made the kitchen and only bathroom inaccessible. He is painting it black and gray, from yellow, which my mom picked out 30 years ago. I'm not contesting that it needed paint long ago, but he is making it awful. He didn't bother to tape the ceiling, which he doesn't plan to paint, the trim is hideous with both black and gray on it because he taped it poorly and it just looks awful. He painted cabinets multiple colors and poorly at that without asking first. He has stuff all over and is taking a very long time to finish. Each night, and whenever he isn't painting, he puts his painting supplies in the bathtub so no one can bathe. You have to go through the kitchen to turn the heat on, and we live in the north east. My mom has a ton of medical problems and needs to have access to food, heat, and the bathroom. She doesn't want to say anything because she is grateful he is trying to help, but he is really causing problems.

But you haven't gotten anywhere? Shit, just a cursory glance at your post history shows that you're pretty much in the same boat as me ( despite myself never having even held a girl's hand). So, what are you going to do? Continue on blindly in the hopes that a girl may pity you enough? You going to continue with such uncertainty until you're thirty? Forty? What if you never achieve any relationship? It's common for people such as us to end up that way, at the tail end of thirty wondering when we'll ever get our chance. Believe me, mate, if they'd have wanted people like us, then we wouldn't be in this situation. I choose not to believe their bullshit about personality mattering. They pick the cream of the crop and then convince the rest that it's our 'personality' that is fucked up, not the fact that we were fucked from the beginning.

"TIFU by forgetting which side of my state I live in I just drove home from an extremely exhausting weekend event. This was suppose to be a four hour drive, and it turned into nearly six and a half, with no stops and no traffic. I get on the highway to go home, heading south. About 45 minutes in there is a junction and I can either take I-64 East or I-64 West. In my exhausted state, it somehow makes sense for me to go east. I'll note here that I live in southwest VA. So I'm driving along and I see a sign that tells me VA Beach is around 65 miles away or something like that. That should have been my first clue. But instead of wondering why I'm being told how far away VA Beach is when I'm suppose to be traveling away from it, I think ""Oh cool I'm close to VA Beach, maybe I'll stop there!"" And I keep driving. **For an hour.** Finally, I see a sign about the infamous bridge-tunnel, and that's when the red flags start going up in my head. I very slowly realized my mistake. It was not a good realization. I was already exhausted and just wanted to be home, and I'd just added two hours, at least, to my trip. Also wasted a quarter tank of gas.

The job I start tomorrow is, from what I was told, a repetitive data entry job at a major oil/energy company. I'll thankfully be making enough to where I can move out in a matter of months.

"Some of my least favorite experiences aren't with people trying to be rude, but people who feel hot and decide that it is okay to sit down right next to or even in front of our tables to get shade. I hate having to shoo these people away and seem like the mean vegan even though it clearly isn't appropriate to just plop themselves down directly in front of our tables. Along those lines there were some girls at the Houston, Texas show who had brought hula hoops to the event and were doing some artistic/acrobatic hula hoop twirling that for some reason they decided to do right next to our tables. After a couple minutes of this, we pointed out to them that people couldn't come up to the table because they didn't want to interfere with their hula hooping and we asked them to choose another spot for what they were doing. One of the girls flipped out at this, she walked about 20 feet away, but then turned back and started shouting things like ""Hey, I don't see anyone at your table! Nobody wants to go up to you guys anyway!"" We mostly ignored her and after a couple minutes she left, but came back later in the day to complain a bit more.

I live in PA and want to use my security as last month's rent as I don't trust management. I have lived there a year and paid a lot of late fees because my job keeps witholding and fucking with my pay. I couldn't save at all because I was paying sometimes 40 a month extra in late fees because of my job. I have also recieved three 10 day eviction notices. The first was for being 10 days late, the second for seven, the third for 2. I had never missed a payment, only paid late. My landlord recently broke my car window and has done nothing toward paying for it. I only have until 10/15 left in the lease and last rent is due 9/15. The entire length of my tenancy the management company has been shady and rude and I don't believe I will see a dime of ny security despite making no damage. I am not worried about future tenancy as I will be living with my parents for some time from then on and can use them to get a new apartment down the road if need be.

Am I fucking myself up by not transitioning? (Xpost asktransgender) I (20 AFAB) identify as genderqueer and transmasculine. I have done nothing to transition, medically or socially, because I don't want to risk my family for it. My mom got three sons and me and has made it clear that she will not support transition. Recently I've started to realize that I have a lot of symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder. One of the symptoms is inconsistent identity. I bounce around from full male to almost female identity all the time, but it doesn't feel the way genderfluid is often described; it's harsh and difficult and hurtful and confusing, not fluid at all. I also have depression and anxiety. I was reading the post about dysphoria and it's effects on you without you knowing and I was just wondering if this could be at all self inflicted. I know you guys and gals aren't trained mental health counselors but if you know anything, please share. I'm sorry if this sounds crazy or in any way transphobic, I don't mean for it to.	am i fucking myself up by not transitioning ? xpost asktransgender i afab identify as genderqueer and transmasculine i have done nothing to transition medically or socially because i don t want to risk my family for it my mom got three sons and me and has made it clear that she will not support transition recently i ve started to realize that i have a lot of symptoms of borderline personality disorder one of the symptoms is inconsistent identity i bounce around from full male to almost female identity all the time but it doesn t feel the way genderfluid is often described it s harsh and difficult and hurtful and confusing not fluid at all i also have depression and anxiety i was reading the post about dysphoria and it s effects on you without you knowing and i was just wondering if this could be at all self inflicted i know you guys and gals aren t trained mental health counselors but if you know anything please share i m sorry if this sounds crazy or in any way transphobic i don t mean for it to 	-0.1753	0.6202	190	1

Edamame Fried Rice [Edamame Fried Rice](https://train_subject1405.wordpress.com/2015/02/18/foodiesphere-moroccan-crockpot-chicken-with-chickpeas-edamame-fired-rice/) Ingredients cooking spray 2 eggs, well beaten 2 tablespoons peanut oil 8 ounces sliced mushrooms 1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped 4 cups broccoli florets 2 cups kale, chopped 4 garlic cloves, minced 1 tablespoon ground ginger 1 cup uncooked short-grain brown rice, cooked according to the package instructions 1 1/2 cups frozen, shelled edamame, defrosted 3 tablespoons soy sauce (or fish sauce) Directions First, the eggs. Coat a skillet with cooking spray and set over high heat. Add the well beaten eggs, turning the pan to coat it with a thin layer of eggs. Cook 30 seconds, loosening the inside edges of the eggs with a spatula. What youre looking to do is create a thin scramble. Once done set aside. Place a large skillet over medium heat (you can use the same skillet as you did for the eggs but make sure its large). Add half the oil. Once hot, add the mushrooms, bell pepper, broccoli, and kale. Cook 5-10 minutes, turning often, until the vegetables soften. Add the garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant. Increase the heat. Push the vegetables to one side of the skillet and add a little more oil and the rice. Cook 1 to 2 minutes, turning the rice over with a metal spatula and scraping up bits that stick to the pan. Add the edamame and soy sauce. Stir well to mix in the soy sauce for 5-10 minutes. Turn off the heat but continue to stir until well mixed, then add eggs.	edamame fried rice edamame fried rice ingredients cooking spray eggs well beaten tablespoons peanut oil ounces sliced mushrooms red bell pepper seeded and chopped cups broccoli cups kale chopped garlic cloves minced tablespoon ground ginger cup uncooked short grain brown rice cooked according to the package instructions cups frozen shelled edamame tablespoons soy sauce or fish sauce directions first the eggs coat a skillet with cooking spray and set over high heat add the well beaten eggs turning the pan to coat it with a thin layer of eggs cook seconds loosening the inside edges of the eggs with a spatula what youre looking to do is create a thin scramble once done set aside place a large skillet over medium heat you can use the same skillet as you did for the eggs but make sure its large add half the oil once hot add the mushrooms bell pepper broccoli and kale cook minutes turning often until the vegetables soften add the garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant increase the heat push the vegetables to one side of the skillet and add a little more oil and the rice cook to minutes turning the rice over with a metal spatula and scraping up bits that stick to the pan add the edamame and soy sauce stir well to mix in the soy sauce for minutes turn off the heat but continue to stir until well mixed then add eggs 	0.0556	0.0	241	0

That is all good and fair, and if they are applying conservative accounting policies by immediately expensing R D then I commend their professionalism. But if that's true then the bigger problem is why are they expensing so much of it? R D can only be capitalized when there is a reasonable expectation that it will eventually yield profits - so if they are expensing nonessentials at this order of magnitude, you really have to wonder whether they are allocating capital wisely. In fact, if I were to give you the benefit of the doubt and accept this as truth, it might be even worse - since it signals that they are desperately trying to come up with something new, which could mean they *know* that their current position is unsustainable. Which is simply dumping water out of a leaking boat.	that is all good and fair and if they are applying conservative accounting policies by immediately expensing r d then i commend their professionalism but if that s true then the bigger problem is why are they expensing so much of it ? r d can only be capitalized when there is a reasonable expectation that it will eventually yield profits so if they are expensing at this order of magnitude you really have to wonder whether they are allocating capital wisely in fact if i were to give you the benefit of the doubt and accept this as truth it might be even worse since it signals that they are desperately trying to come up with something new which could mean they *know* that their current position is unsustainable which is simply dumping water out of a leaking boat 	0.1249	0.4167	140	0

Two main reasons: 1. High Sugar 2. High Caffeine and/or Other Stimulants When you eat sugar, your body tries to regulate itself. It does this by causing the pancreas (an organ in your body that makes digestive enzymes to break down your food) to produce a hormone called insulin which helps your body absorb the sugar and turn it into energy or else store it for later use. When you have a lot of sugar, the pancreas tries to produce more insulin to cope. But doing this often can damage the pancreas and over time it can no longer function properly and can't produce enough insulin. Poor insulin creation or absorbtion is a condition called diabetes. If left untreated, all this extra sugar floating around in your blood causes your blood vessels to harden and this can lead to a bunch of nasty conditions like kidney failure, heart attacks, blindness, nerve damage, etc. Source: [here](http://www.webmd.com/diabetes/how-sugar-affects-diabetes?page=2) and for more information on the 2 types of diabetes see [here](http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/medicine/insulin/diabetes-insulin.html) Sugar is also terrible for your teeth, and its presence causes the acidity in your mouth to increase as you break down the sugar. When the acidity level in your mouth increases, it eats away at the enamel of your teeth, causing tooth decay. Source: [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/health/the-mouths-guard.html?_r=0) Not to mention if you are having a lot of sugar all the time you are likely to be eating more than your daily required intake of Calories/kilojoules and become overweight, which can lead to a number of other health issues. Caffeine can actually be good in small doses, as it stimulates your central nervous system and causes your heart rate to increase. It is also a diuretic (makes you need to go to the bathroom). A high heart rate can be useful when you need increased mental alertness but it can be bad if you are trying to sleep. It can also have other side effects such as headaches and vomiting if in really high doses. Large amounts of caffeine can also reduce calcium absorbtion and can increase your chance of developing osteoporosis (thin bones). If caffeine is not present they use other stimulants like guarana to have the same effect. Also when these stimulants are combined with alcohol they can mask how drunk you are, so you are likely to drink more than you might otherwise.

Jurassic Park movies have always had very very normal every day looking characters. They were always believable and real and were perfect for the 'ordinary person in an extraordinary situation' theme that Spielberg has always been great at. I mean don't get me wrong, Neill and Goldblum and Dern are all good looking people, but they were realistically good looking, and were just ordinary realistically-aged unexceptional scientists who were out of their element. This whole cast looks super young and fit and Hollywood-attractive, and people have even been saying Pratt is playing an ex-marine dinosaur wrangler. Doesn't exactly seem like the same realistic relatable ordinary regular cast of characters we're used to from this franchise. But hey, I'm sure it's no big deal and I'm still super excited for this movie in a big big way.	jurassic park movies have always had very very normal every day looking characters they were always believable and real and were perfect for the ordinary person in an extraordinary situation theme that spielberg has always been great at i mean don t get me wrong neill and goldblum and dern are all good looking people but they were realistically good looking and were just ordinary realistically aged scientists who were out of their element this whole cast looks super young and fit and hollywood attractive and people have even been saying pratt is playing an ex marine dinosaur wrangler doesn t exactly seem like the same realistic relatable ordinary regular cast of characters we re used to from this franchise but hey i m sure it s no big deal and i m still super excited for this movie in a big big way 	0.2046	0.0	144	0

Honestly, with the way this group is playing, it appears as though we are only going to be able to compete against the bottom third (maybe even bottom quarter!) of the league. Our division is very strong, and we have little to no chance against OKC when they get healthy (hell, we already botched one game against them when they were under-manned). If you figure that we show up and compete hard in the games where we aren't out-matched, talent-wise, I can see us around 10 wins come January. I mean, we have 32 games before Jan 1st. 10-22 seems WAY above how this team is performing right now, doesn't it? That's going 8-15 over the next 1.5 months. It is possible, but I think unlikely. Now, for what I think happens. Others are correct in that we have a lot of pieces (and very good ones!) for which to offer some contenders. Once January comes around, if we're sub-10 wins, I think we go for the all-out tank, and start trading some of those pieces to contenders. I think that you make two of Ty, Faried, and Gallo untouchable, but everyone else can be got. I think that is a splendid core, and allows us to offer Mozgov to Cleveland, Foye to a team who needs a 3-point shooter, Nate to a contender who wants a little more bench scoring, etc, etc. Stockpile picks and young talent, and hope the balls come out in our favor. This team looks like garbage right now, and the NBA isn't exactly fair with its talent acquisition process (Chicago, LA, NY will ALWAYS have an advantage over Denver, Sacramento, and even OKC), but we have done a very good job nabbing talent in the middle of the 1st round in the recent past (Faried and Lawson being the shining examples). We need that star to kick us up a notch. As for Shaw? My jury is still out on that one. This may just be a McDaniels situation (not the cheating, petulant, horrible human being part - just the inexperience in Head Coaching and poor player relationships part) that we have to scrape away and start anew. It'll be very telling how he and the team handle this gigantic suckfest that I predict will soon be upon us.	honestly with the way this group is playing it appears as though we are only going to be able to compete against the bottom third maybe even bottom quarter ! of the league our division is very strong and we have little to no chance against okc when they get healthy hell we already botched one game against them when they were under manned if you figure that we show up and compete hard in the games where we aren t out matched talent wise i can see us around wins come january i mean we have games before seems way above how this team is performing right now doesn t it ? that s going over the next months it is possible but i think unlikely now for what i think happens others are correct in that we have a lot of pieces and very good ones ! for which to offer some contenders once january comes around if we re sub wins i think we go for the all out tank and start trading some of those pieces to contenders i think that you make two of ty and gallo untouchable but everyone else can be got i think that is a splendid core and allows us to offer mozgov to cleveland to a team who needs a point shooter nate to a contender who wants a little more bench scoring etc etc stockpile picks and young talent and hope the balls come out in our favor this team looks like garbage right now and the nba isn t exactly fair with its talent acquisition process chicago la ny will always have an advantage over denver sacramento and even okc but we have done a very good job talent in the middle of the st round in the recent past and lawson being the shining examples we need that star to kick us up a notch as for shaw ? my jury is still out on that one this may just be a mcdaniels situation not the cheating petulant horrible human being part just the inexperience in head coaching and poor player relationships part that we have to scrape away and start anew it ll be very telling how he and the team handle this gigantic that i predict will soon be upon us 	0.1191	0.382	386	0

I went through two containers of that stuff. It smells great and the formula isn't greasy. It's not too expensive compared to other products for KP. So far I've used Alpha Hydrox lotion, gold bonds, cerave renewing SA Cream, and am lactin. Gold bonds wins hands down. I like the results from the cerave but it leaves my skin feeling sticky and weird. Totally recommend the gold bonds! I also recommend using it as little as you can afford to and moisturize with a cheaper body lotion in between. Kind of obvious but keeping the skin moisturized helps with the bumps. I can get away with every other day now, and keeping the areas shaved, moisturized, and exfoliated.

Yea the Pittsburgh interview was when Frank planned the implosion. In Chapter 10 @8:40 Peter and Frank have a heated discussion where Peter tells Frank he isn't afraid of him anymore. The Watershed Bill failed and his people need the jobs he promised them and Frank had better fix it. The next scene is Doug and Frank discussing accelerating their unspecified plan. Peter's confidence has been built up and they're losing control of him. It's time to put him away. This is the plan to have Rachel seduce Doug the night before a radio interview and get him drunk after being sober for so long. So Frank schedules the interview and tells Peter to be ready and to go to this gala the night before. There, Rachel works her magic at the hotel, and boom goes the dynamite. Killing Peter was really just a spur of the moment decision by Frank. When they're in the garage, Peter is drunkenly babbling on about needing to come clean about everything that's happened. Well Frank can't have that. Peter wasn't supposed to be a liability after he withdrew from the Governor's race, but clearly he'll always be a thorn in his side. So how do we deal with a perpetual Peter problem? You put him down.

Finally getting rid of my old schoolbooks. In 2009-2010 I tried going to school to become a nurse aide/patient care technician/phlebotomist. I've never really had an interest in any of that but I was being pressured into going to school. It was a disaster. I was successful at becoming a nurse aide, but I hated every part of it. The rest? It was miserable. I felt like no matter how hard I studied I couldn't grasp it and forget actually sticking people with needles. I could do it when my aunt (a nurse) showed me, but in front of the teachers? One issue was that I knew one teacher had no confidence in me, so that made it worse. Well, I dropped out because I was failing anyway. But that's not what's bothered me for 3 years. Yeah, I failed college, but a lot of people do that. The hard part was that I just wasted thousands of dollars of my parents' money. They might think I'm ungrateful, but I spent 3 years being unable to look at my books because I felt so guilty, and they made me feel so unintelligent. They sat under my bed but even knowing they were there bothered me. Well, I threw away my workbooks and the textbooks I have in my car to take to Goodwill tomorrow. I doubt they'd be assigned now, but they'd make good reference books for someone. The fact that I basically threw thousands of my parents dollars out of the window will always bother me, but at least I feel like I can move on now, especially since I'm attempting college again this fall, and this time, it's something I actually have some interest in. And I'm paying for it. Even if I fail again, at least the financial burden will be on me.	finally getting rid of my old in i tried going to school to become a nurse aide patient care technician i ve never really had an interest in any of that but i was being pressured into going to school it was a disaster i was successful at becoming a nurse aide but i hated every part of it the rest ? it was miserable i felt like no matter how hard i studied i couldn t grasp it and forget actually sticking people with needles i could do it when my aunt a nurse showed me but in front of the teachers ? one issue was that i knew one teacher had no confidence in me so that made it worse well i dropped out because i was failing anyway but that s not what s bothered me for years yeah i failed college but a lot of people do that the hard part was that i just wasted thousands of dollars of my parents money they might think i m ungrateful but i spent years being unable to look at my books because i felt so guilty and they made me feel so unintelligent they sat under my bed but even knowing they were there bothered me well i threw away my and the textbooks i have in my car to take to goodwill tomorrow i doubt they d be assigned now but they d make good reference books for someone the fact that i basically threw thousands of my parents dollars out of the window will always bother me but at least i feel like i can move on now especially since i m attempting college again this fall and this time it s something i actually have some interest in and i m paying for it even if i fail again at least the financial burden will be on me 	-0.1889	0.5551	314	1

A basic tenet of equality is that things are unfair when the playing field is leveled. It's the reason you don't see the Miami Midgets playing for the NFL - they would get beating pretty badly, wouldn't they? So give the rest of the populace a police cruiser, a badge, and a gun, and only then can this be about equality. Cops should absolutely be judged with a discriminating eye. For one, they are rarely convicted, and two, there are hardly any cases where additional charges have been brought about. It's either that or riots.

To be 100% honest, it's not their concern. If they were a better fit, they would be doing it. If they're just criticizing with no aspirations, then the manager should consider it to be noise so long as they accept that valid points may be made that contribute to personal or professional betterment. But the truth is that a lot of times subordinates are just bored and looking for things to get upset with. If someone has a legitimate concern, to reiterate what I said, they need to bring it to their manager. If the manager fails to act, go above them.

Yeah but without the French the Revolution wouldn't have gotten anywhere. You could argue the same thing in Eastern Ukraine: A small amount of Eastern Ukrainians were legitimately angry with the Kiev revolt and decided to revolt themselves. Russia took advantage of the situation and poured forth supplies and manpower into the rebels. A lot of Western media seems to portray the Eastern Ukrainians as never actually wanting to secede and that the Russians basically manufactured all of the dissent, but I doubt the Russians would've had so much success in escalating the conflict if there hadn't been at least some grievance amongst the local population.	yeah but without the french the revolution wouldn t have gotten anywhere you could argue the same thing in eastern ukraine a small amount of eastern ukrainians were legitimately angry with the kiev revolt and decided to revolt themselves russia took advantage of the situation and poured forth supplies and manpower into the rebels a lot of western media seems to portray the eastern ukrainians as never actually wanting to secede and that the russians basically manufactured all of the dissent but i doubt the russians would ve had so much success in escalating the conflict if there hadn t been at least some grievance amongst the local population 	-0.0833	0.3526	109	1

39 States now have mandates to provide these services if employees are on a certain plan. Virginia is on that list but not sure if that plan would cover it. I agree with /u/cakeisatruth that ABA is not the only way but has been found to be beneficial by the U.S. government take that as you may. Additionally, Temple Grandin has came out and said that ABA is beneficial but the more important part is finding what your child loves and use that as a motivator. I have noticed that when therapy is provided that is what happens during ABA. Speech, and occupational therapy are added benefits and will compound those self life skills.

"The worst I've ever played? Probably [The Nettestadt Troll](http://www.renai.us/game/nettestadt.shtml). I didn't expect that much since it's one of those free Ren'py games that's essentially the equivalent of a bad fanfic, but this one is especially bad. For one thing, the art is terrible. All of the women are drawn the same, just with different hair and colors. The backgrounds look like something you'd find in an elementary or middle school art class. It is thoroughly mediocre. Also, the plot is super contrived and full of holes. It takes places in some random German village in the 1500s-ish. In the beginning the guys that are all your love interests get involved in some sort of uprising against the local lord, then there's a time skip and the village is being terrorized by a troll that threatens them with ... something (to be frank I don't even remember what the threat was). In order to appease the troll, the entire town decides to let the protag get dragged off by him to a cottage in the middle of the woods to be his sex slave. And then suddenly she is his waifu ... it makes absolutely no sense. But what tops it off is the whole German thing. It's obviously made by someone who doesn't know that much about the German language or culture, because for most of the game there are no indications of such and then occasionally it's like the person who wrote it went ""OH CRAP I NEED SOME GERMAN STUFF IN HERE"" and it ends up coming off a bit like that scene from Evangelion [where Shinji climbs into Unit 02 with Asuka](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion#Asuka_Strikes.21_.5B1.8.5D). I think the kicker was when the troll is trying to seduce the protag and he asks her, ""if I were a bratwurst, would you be my bun?"" At that point I about died laughing.

How do they date a pregnancy for someone with irregular periods? How do they take implantation into account? That can take place 6-12 days after conception. So what do they do if LMP is useless in this case? It could be nearly 2 weeks off if implantation isn't considered. How far along would they tell a woman she is? Would they just take the age of the fetus from an ultrasound and add 2 weeks? Sorry about deleting the last post, but I noticed an error.	how do they date a pregnancy for someone with irregular periods ? how do they take implantation into account ? that can take place days after conception so what do they do if is useless in this case ? it could be nearly weeks off if implantation isn t considered how far along would they tell a woman she is ? would they just take the age of the fetus from an ultrasound and add weeks ? sorry about deleting the last post but i noticed an error 	-0.16	0.239	88	1

Loki (616) vs Batman (nu52) This is a matter of preptime. I've heard and seen they are both ridiculous at it (beware of circle jerkers). Round 1: both get a week of preptime to figure out how to appease the hunger of Galactus. Round 2: both get 6 months to figure out how to take down a higher tiered member of a different universe. (Loki vs Superman, Batman vs Thor) Round 3: both get 5 years to prepare a contingency for something that they should not/cannot do by themselves. Situations are Loki vs Darkseid and Batman vs Thanos.

I sort of count. I am 1/4 Filipino and 1/4 hispanic. But unlike my sister I look mostly white. This sometimes puts me in weird situations like when someone says something about Mexicans or whatever assuming there is no one around to offend/that it is okay to be racist. One time I was with a friend and her friend at the house he lived at with another guy. I was maybe 15 at the time so it was somewhat shocking and I don't remember all the details. So we are hanging out and the roommate seemed kind of cockey but whatever, then my friend brings up that I am 'asian' or something. The guy immediately started being insulting about it and acting irritated. He kept being rude to me until I told my friend that I needed to get the fuck out of there and we left. It was really weird. Aside from that I don't like that with white friends I have had I am the token brown friend or something, and then all my brown friends (not to mention my family) tease me for being white.	i sort of count i am filipino and hispanic but unlike my sister i look mostly white this sometimes puts me in weird situations like when someone says something about mexicans or whatever assuming there is no one around to offend that it is okay to be racist one time i was with a friend and her friend at the house he lived at with another guy i was maybe at the time so it was somewhat shocking and i don t remember all the details so we are hanging out and the roommate seemed kind of but whatever then my friend brings up that i am asian or something the guy immediately started being insulting about it and acting irritated he kept being rude to me until i told my friend that i needed to get the fuck out of there and we left it was really weird aside from that i don t like that with white friends i have had i am the token brown friend or something and then all my brown friends not to mention my family tease me for being white 	-0.1857	0.3753	187	1

The amount of that that was going on was nothing. Are they going to ban every sub that has a small percentage of readers brigading elsewhere? It has nothing to do with that.

It's not about brigading, and don't think for a second that it's not at least 95% about the fat hate. Second point: One of the other banned subs is /r/hamplanethatred. I'm a *very* active FPH poster and I'd never even heard of that sub.

Thank you. That saves me some work in regards to the Kurds. As for pure 'humanitarian' donations for those who want to avoid all politics there is the [Syrian Red Crescent](http://sarc.sy). Be aware that I am unfamiliar with this outfit. I hope it isn't like the Red Cross where 1)you have no control over *what* your donation goes to ie not always the particular call you responded to and 2) a far too large amount of revenue goes to 'administration'. there is also the [UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs](http://www.unocha.org/syria). With this outfit you can be assured that the money donated will go to the cause specified. I don't, however, know about the 'administration overhead'. It's probably less than that of the Red Cross given funding from the UN itself. I've got to remember to add these pathways to solidarity in future. The donation path is contained in the SFF, but it is hidden in the website.	thank you that saves me some work in regards to the kurds as for pure humanitarian donations for those who want to avoid all politics there is the syrian red crescent be aware that i am unfamiliar with this outfit i hope it isn t like the red cross where you have no control over *what* your donation goes to ie not always the particular call you responded to and a far too large amount of revenue goes to administration there is also the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs with this outfit you can be assured that the money donated will go to the cause specified i don t however know about the administration overhead it s probably less than that of the red cross given funding from the un itself i ve got to remember to add these pathways to solidarity in future the donation path is contained in the but it is hidden in the website 	0.0471	0.156	161	0

it was a rule invented for more kid friendly stuff It's actually more to do with having recurring villains. For example, Batman has been published for over 75 years and across dozens of different monthly titles, limited series, one-shots, graphic novels, etc. If Batman killed his villains, the writers would have to keep coming up new ones all the time and we wouldn't have all these classic recurring characters. What people fail to understand is that movies don't have this problem. The Joker is probably only going to appear once per franchise, so killing him doesn't matter. As for Man of Steel, the kill meant something. It seemed to be the only thing he could do at the time, and he'll face the consequences for it. It's going to be pivotal moment for him and he'll have decisions to make. Guys like Lex will get to make multiple appearances throughout the DC Cinematic Universe because Superman is going to have to think up better ways of handling his adversaries than execution or no one will trust him and he's too powerful a being to be both untrusted *and* left alone.	it was a rule invented for more kid friendly stuff it s actually more to do with having recurring villains for example batman has been published for over years and across dozens of different monthly titles limited series one shots graphic novels etc if batman killed his villains the writers would have to keep coming up new ones all the time and we wouldn t have all these classic recurring characters what people fail to understand is that movies don t have this problem the joker is probably only going to appear once per franchise so killing him doesn t matter as for man of steel the kill meant something it seemed to be the only thing he could do at the time and he ll face the consequences for it it s going to be pivotal moment for him and he ll have decisions to make guys like lex will get to make multiple appearances throughout the dc cinematic universe because superman is going to have to think up better ways of handling his adversaries than execution or no one will trust him and he s too powerful a being to be both untrusted *and* left alone 	0.1226	0.6122	198	0

As someone whose parents left each other *way* too late in the game, I think you should probably just try to figure out custody for your kids and separate from her. She can't make you stay. Your kids will be mad for a while, but believe me, it's better to spare them the trauma of living in a house where both parents absolutely hate each other. I'm just speaking from personal experience here, but I wish I could unhear the things my parents said to each other and unsee the things they did to each other when they fought. Even though the idea of them getting divorced seemed scary to me when I was a teenager, I wish they hadn't waited 'til I left for college to separate. It would have spared me a lot of pain. I don't know what your situation with your wife is--whether there's abuse involved or what--but it could potentially spare your children a lot more pain and uncertainty if you were to separate sooner rather than later.	as someone whose parents left each other *way* too late in the game i think you should probably just try to figure out custody for your kids and separate from her she can t make you stay your kids will be mad for a while but believe me it s better to spare them the trauma of living in a house where both parents absolutely hate each other i m just speaking from personal experience here but i wish i could unhear the things my parents said to each other and unsee the things they did to each other when they fought even though the idea of them getting divorced seemed scary to me when i was a teenager i wish they hadn t waited til i left for college to separate it would have spared me a lot of pain i don t know what your situation with your wife is whether there s abuse involved or what but it could potentially spare your children a lot more pain and uncertainty if you were to separate sooner rather than later 	-0.1328	0.5573	181	1

Labeling laws are kind of the last resort of people who are concerned about ecological effects. The federal government is a revolving door with the biotech industry. Look at [this chart](http://occupy-monsanto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/individual_monsanto_federal_position-large.jpg) for details. Because of the governments unwillingness to impose rigorous testing standards, and instead rely on the companies' own research to approve new strains, the only option a concerned citizen has is to avoid supporting the industry with their purchasing power. Of course, this is very difficult to do if we don't have knowledge of which products contain GMOs, and that's the way they like it.	labeling laws are kind of the last resort of people who are concerned about ecological effects the federal government is a revolving door with the biotech industry look at this chart for details because of the governments unwillingness to impose rigorous testing standards and instead rely on the companies own research to approve new strains the only option a concerned citizen has is to avoid supporting the industry with their purchasing power of course this is very difficult to do if we don t have knowledge of which products contain gmos and that s the way they like it 	0.167	0.184	99	0

I am like you, my brain just won't stop. I have a lot of trouble sleeping, and it makes my depression even worse.

I have found going through this process works for me a little. Maybe you can try it and see how you go? I usually like to write it out because it gets it out of my head and onto paper. 1. Notice you're feeling uncomfortable emotions. 2. Identify all the emotions you're feeling - angry, sad, frustrated, annoyed, etc. 3. Once you've done that try to rationalise them - why do I feel this way? Did I do something or did someone else do something to make me feel like this? 4. Figure out - is your feeling/reaction helpful? If No - then you need to let it go e.g. by forgiving yourself. If Yes - work out what action you can take and when. Then until you can take that action, leave it aside and don't think about it anymore, until the time you take the action.	i am like you my brain just won t stop i have a lot of trouble sleeping and it makes my depression even worse sometimes i keep myself busy only to have nightmares because all those repressed feelings are coming out when i sleep what makes you think you re a failure ? i have found going through this process works for me a little maybe you can try it and see how you go ? i usually like to write it out because it gets it out of my head and onto paper notice you re feeling uncomfortable emotions identify all the emotions you re feeling angry sad frustrated annoyed etc once you ve done that try to rationalise them why do i feel this way ? did i do something or did someone else do something to make me feel like this ? figure out is your feeling reaction helpful ? if no then you need to let it go e g by forgiving yourself if yes work out what action you can take and when then until you can take that action leave it aside and don t think about it anymore until the time you take the action 	-0.2369	0.4848	202	1

It was just a horrible alternative to feeling nothing.	it feels like a weight pushing down on me just enough to make me hate everything it makes my thoughts loud cold and for the most part logical i don t cry it s just numbness it feels like pressure you know that feeling you get when you know you ve hurt yourself badly like a deep cut or really bad bruise and it s so bad you can t even feel it well it s like that all the time sometimes i get sick of feeling like this i can only take stuffing it down so long i used to get angry quite a lot not these days but i used to it was just a horrible alternative to feeling nothing 	-0.3074	0.3793	122	1

I can relate to you in some part. Especially telling people that I don't care but in fact I do care. The important thing is though that you're doing something. And anger, though unhealthy in large doses, can be evidence of better things. For instance you have a goal and motivation to achieve it so you are frustrated by slow progress. But hang in there, and try to keep it up. And don't beat yourself up too hard. Leave that to the strangers on the internet.	i can relate to you in some part especially telling people that i don t care but in fact i do care the important thing is though that you re doing something and anger though unhealthy in large doses can be evidence of better things for instance you have a goal and motivation to achieve it so you are frustrated by slow progress but hang in there and try to keep it up and don t beat yourself up too hard leave that to the strangers on the internet 	-0.1419	0.401	89	1

[SPOILER] Question that I think might be important later on... The doctor saw a silent in his TARDIS before and after asking rory about why amy river are cross. That's something I didn't notice before. But my question is this: why was the doctor an idiot at flying the TARDIS on his way to the oval office? River corrected him a few times (scanner, invisibility, silencing the engines) and it doesn't make sense. it's just a random thing that occurs.... which is why i think it's important. Something about this is screaming TARDIS but I can't figure it out. Stetson doctor didn't interact with the TARDIS at all. why not? why send the invitations if he could just hop over and pick everyone up? **EDIT** I'm watching it over and scrutinizing every scene. The scene where they initially get to FL and are using their flashlights (or torches) to get around, you see a spaceman watching them. Look in the reflection of his mask and you can see the doctor acknowledge him. I'm going with River Song's number one rule on this one... *the doctor lies*	spoiler question that i think might be important later on the doctor saw a silent in his tardis before and after asking rory about why amy river are cross that s something i didn t notice before but my question is this why was the doctor an idiot at flying the tardis on his way to the oval office ? river corrected him a few times scanner invisibility silencing the engines and it doesn t make sense it s just a random thing that occurs which is why i think it s important something about this is screaming tardis but i can t figure it out doctor didn t interact with the tardis at all why not ? why send the invitations if he could just hop over and pick everyone up ? *edit* i m watching it over and scrutinizing every scene the scene where they initially get to fl and are using their flashlights or torches to get around you see a spaceman watching them look in the reflection of his mask and you can see the doctor acknowledge him i m going with river song s number one rule on this one the doctor lies 	-0.0778	0.252	198	1

A- Some wrestlers do hold on to the ropes to stop their momentum when their opponent expects them to rebound and run back at them. As for why they don't just stop running before even reaching the ropes/turnbuckle-- it's probably extremely difficult to do so while being thrown by a human being the size of an apartment complex. Human feet don't have brake pads; if they tried to suddenly stop during an Irish Whip, they might very well just fall flat on their face, or at least stumble uncontrollably.	a some wrestlers do hold on to the ropes to stop their momentum when their opponent expects them to rebound and run back at them as for why they don t just stop running before even reaching the ropes turnbuckle it s probably extremely difficult to do so while being thrown by a human being the size of an apartment complex human feet don t have brake pads if they tried to suddenly stop during an irish whip they might very well just fall flat on their face or at least stumble uncontrollably 	-0.0886	0.418	93	1
Yea I've seen similar situations where one among a group of irl friends suddenly dies. It seems to sometimes spur others on to make improvements in their own world (I am thinking specifically of one young man that died of an overdose; not long after at least one of his good friends went sober, so yay to that).

Alpha (Shinji) and Lambda (Kaworu) revisited A year or so ago, [/u/shinjieva2007](http://www.reddit.com/user/shinjieva2007) [*posted a question about this*](http://www.reddit.com/r/evangelion/comments/1dgfi9/alpha_and_lambda_why_those_two_characters_on/), which was mostly dismissed as being incorrect, concluding that the [letters on Shinji's and Kaworu's backs](http://i.imgur.com/GcumVGK.gifv) were upper () and lower () case alpha symbols. Having recently rewatched the rebuilds, I have to disagree with the previous votes and agree with /u/shinjieva2007 that it is indeed a lambda symbol (), and I would like to bring this question up for discussion again with additional information: The reasoning to bolster the Lambda arguement is that it is the symbol for a [cosmological constant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant). If you look at this in regards to the time-loop/divergence theories, I think this fits well; as it implies that Kaworu is a constant observer in what is happening through the cycles - and goes along with his cryptic remarks in 3.33 that imply things are happening *again*. The symbol is used notably in [Einstein's field equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations) describing space-time.

:-( Nope. The relationship (we were never official) lasted about 4 minutes. _ Obviously exaggerating :P, but yeah. She didn't feel like I was worth committing to, partly I guess because she didn't think we were compatible, and also because she was an extremely studious pharmacology major. I don't resent her for it at all. I'm just a little upset I lost her. She was my dream girl, and I got her number accidentally. That's like a downer ending to a bad romance movie.	sad nope the relationship we were never official lasted about minutes _ obviously exaggerating tong but yeah she didn t feel like i was worth committing to partly i guess because she didn t think we were compatible and also because she was an extremely studious pharmacology major i don t resent her for it at all i m just a little upset i lost her she was my dream girl and i got her number accidentally that s like a downer ending to a bad romance movie 	-0.0812	0.4906	88	1

I guess so, but RR (or at least, the ones I worked at) are particularly bad (especially compared to say, McDonald's - I have worked there also). A few things off the top of my head: * It is common to still serve food that has been dropped on the floor * Chips are often served 30+ minutes old in a slow period - the heater keeps them hot but they are still old chips (they are sometimes dipped back into the fryer to freshen them up) * Stores would regurlarly re-date the desserts kept in the fridge - it was not uncommon for customers to come back complaining about their cheesecake or chocolate mousse being sour/out of date/otherwise off * When food was returned to us (due to a customer complaint) it would often be re-used (with us having no idea what the customer has done to it during the time it took for them to bring it back) * Our gravy and mashed potato is just made from powder + hot water (this one ain't so bad, cause it tastes fucking delicious anyway lol) * Rooster rolls are made using 3+ day old chicken that they were unable to sell. They are made in the morning and kept in the fridge until close and are simply microwaved when they get ordered - it is not uncommon to find bones in them (kitchen staff have to strip the chicken from the carcass when making them, and kitchen staff are fucking lazy) * If you order chips without salt, there's about an 80% chance they will simply drop already salted chips back into the fryer for a few seconds and then serve them to you * Those banana fritters that everyone loves - has anyone tried pulling off the crumbs to see the banana underneath? 95% of the time they're a mushy, black mess. * Gloves and hairnets are optional The ONLY thing you should eat from that place is the roast chicken. They have good quality chicken, and it is properly slow roasted in ovens (although how clean those ovens are depends on how quickly the kitchen closer wanted to get out the night before) for about an hour.	i guess so but rr or at least the ones i worked at are particularly bad especially compared to say mcdonald s i have worked there also a few things off the top of my head it is common to still serve food that has been dropped on the floor chips are often served minutes old in a slow period the heater keeps them hot but they are still old chips they are sometimes dipped back into the fryer to freshen them up stores would re date the desserts kept in the fridge it was not uncommon for customers to come back complaining about their cheesecake or chocolate mousse being sour out of date otherwise off when food was returned to us due to a customer complaint it would often be re used with us having no idea what the customer has done to it during the time it took for them to bring it back our gravy and mashed potato is just made from powder hot water this one ain t so bad cause it tastes fucking delicious anyway lol rooster rolls are made using day old chicken that they were unable to sell they are made in the morning and kept in the fridge until close and are simply when they get ordered it is not uncommon to find bones in them kitchen staff have to strip the chicken from the carcass when making them and kitchen staff are fucking lazy if you order chips without salt there s about an chance they will simply drop already salted chips back into the fryer for a few seconds and then serve them to you those banana that everyone loves has anyone tried pulling off the crumbs to see the banana underneath ? of the time they re a mushy black mess gloves and are optional the only thing you should eat from that place is the roast chicken they have good quality chicken and it is properly slow roasted in ovens although how clean those ovens are depends on how quickly the kitchen closer wanted to get out the night before for about an hour 	-0.0825	0.386	356	1

[Build Help] Which GPU should I upgrade to? Hey, guys. So I've had my GTX 560Ti for about a year now, and I've been noticing some problems. My computer will crash randomly whilst playing some games, and when I check my event log, it tells me that these crashes are due to a Kernel-Power Event. On further investigation it appeared that my GPU was the cause behind these crashes,so I've decided that if they continue, I'll probably have to replace my GPU. Question is, which GPU should I buy if I choose to do so? (keeping in mind I'd prefer to upgrade in performance as well). Or should I spend money on getting my GPU fixed instead?	build help which gpu should i upgrade to ? hey guys so i ve had my gtx ti for about a year now and i ve been noticing some problems my computer will crash randomly whilst playing some games and when i check my event log it tells me that these crashes are due to a kernel power event on further investigation it appeared that my gpu was the cause behind these crashes so i ve decided that if they continue i ll probably have to replace my gpu question is which gpu should i buy if i choose to do so ? keeping in mind i d prefer to upgrade in performance as well or should i spend money on getting my gpu fixed instead ? 	-0.185	0.5	127	1

Insurance companies are providing a service and taking on risk. Why shouldn't they be profitable? If insurance companies can be profitable while helping slow the rise of health care costs then isn't that good? They are private corporations that are competing against each other so hopefully they are being forced to constantly strive to provide better service at lower cost. They are also a force that helps control cost increases from pharmaceutical, medical equipment companies, doctors and hospitals that also want to be profitable. In my state there are also options from an ACA-marketplace insurance provider that is a non-profit. County health services are taxpayer funded and have no competition. They get the same budget regardless of how well they're meeting the needs of the community. I have a problem with that. It's certainly a complex issue but what we were doing hasn't been working too well. The idea of the ACA has been around for a long time and I'm willing to see if it produces results.	insurance companies are providing a service and taking on risk why shouldn t they be profitable ? if insurance companies can be profitable while helping slow the rise of health care costs then isn t that good ? they are private corporations that are competing against each other so hopefully they are being forced to constantly strive to provide better service at lower cost they are also a force that helps control cost increases from pharmaceutical medical equipment companies doctors and hospitals that also want to be profitable in my state there are also options from an aca marketplace insurance provider that is a non profit county health services are taxpayer funded and have no competition they get the same budget regardless of how well they re meeting the needs of the community i have a problem with that it s certainly a complex issue but what we were doing hasn t been working too well the idea of the aca has been around for a long time and i m willing to see if it produces results 	0.0312	0.3205	178	0

My sister is an atheist and I am Christian. Being Christian, I know that I can't make a real point to my religion because it doesn't make sense; that's why it's called faith. I have no problem with my sister being atheist and think she can believe whatever she wants, yet she regularly brings up the beliefs of Catholics and why she is not one. She not only does this around me, but around our Catholic family. Then we all get very uncomfortable because there is no way for us to back our beliefs because they are spiritual, not logical. I think she constantly brings it up because she is worried that people won't understand or are displeased with her for being atheist, yet we don't really have any opinion of it, we just don't want to have to explain to her why we believe what we believe because, well, we can't. **TL;DR** People can believe whatever they like, just don't try to reason your beliefs because you'll just get in a heated discussion that makes everyone uncomfortable and angry.	my sister is an atheist and i am christian being christian i know that i can t make a real point to my religion because it doesn t make sense that s why it s called faith i have no problem with my sister being atheist and think she can believe whatever she wants yet she regularly brings up the beliefs of catholics and why she is not one she not only does this around me but around our catholic family then we all get very uncomfortable because there is no way for us to back our beliefs because they are spiritual not logical i think she constantly brings it up because she is worried that people won t understand or are displeased with her for being atheist yet we don t really have any opinion of it we just don t want to have to explain to her why we believe what we believe because well we can t tl dr people can believe whatever they like just don t try to reason your beliefs because you ll just get in a heated discussion that makes everyone uncomfortable and angry 	-0.0783	0.525	191	1

Yeah. I could just see you licking your finger and taking a taste. Been there, done that. One of the better applications for the SG is savory, rather than sweet. FYI if you don't know. That little box is strong and powerful stuff. If you add 1 tsp SG to 1 cup of any other spice seasoning mix, you'll see a difference.

"I make the same observations as you. I know a lot of mediocre djs who shamelessly promote themselves online and have managed to garner a decent following. I say shamelessly because their mixes range from awful to decidedly mediocre, yet their audience does not seem to mind, and neither do they. Maybe the audience is not knowledgeable enough to discern the mistakes? Out of respect for myself and the art of djing, I hesitate to release mixes that contain amateurish mistakes such as trainwrecks, extended periods of off-key mixing, or uneven eq-ing of tracks. I'm not any way hating on them. We all have to start somewhere. I like to think that they don't know they are bad because they are ignorant to what ""good"" is. They don't even know that they don't know. I think if your goal is to dj to a larger crowd then you have to market yourself. Create an online presence, network with other djs and promoters, attend club events and mingle with the crowd, pass out demo cds. If you are as good as you say you are, naturally you will gain a following because you are offering a superior product compared to the other (worse) djs."	i make the same observations as you i know a lot of mediocre djs who shamelessly promote themselves online and have managed to garner a decent following i say shamelessly because their mixes range from awful to decidedly mediocre yet their audience does not seem to mind and neither do they maybe the audience is not knowledgeable enough to discern the mistakes ? out of respect for myself and the art of djing i hesitate to release mixes that contain amateurish mistakes such as extended periods of off key mixing or uneven eq ing of tracks i m not any way hating on them we all have to start somewhere i like to think that they don t know they are bad because they are ignorant to what good is they don t even know that they don t know i think if your goal is to dj to a larger crowd then you have to market yourself create an online presence network with other djs and promoters attend club events and mingle with the crowd pass out demo cds if you are as good as you say you are naturally you will gain a following because you are offering a superior product compared to the other worse djs 	-0.0792	0.379	209	0
The problem with Peruvians on US E are that you have people from a poor and very uneducated 3rd world country queuing with people from arguably the most developed nation in the world. If you don't speak English, or can't understand English, you shouldn't be allowed to queue for a server hosted in a country that speaks English as its default language in a game that relies heavily on communication and coordination. If I went to the South American servers not being able to speak Spanish or Portuguese I would be in the wrong. If I queued for SEA without knowing any Asian languages, I would be in the wrong. There are 3 servers hosted in South America. I'm sorry your country is a poor shit hole and you get worse ping to SA servers but you're ruining other people's games just by being in it on US E.

Fuck yeah, I have experience to comment! Where I worked, the franchise paid minimum wage to drivers (8.05) but after a checklist, you'd get a 50 cent raise (8.55) we made 5% on all deliveries, and only delivered 5-8 mins from the store. Not all that bad, can quickly get deliveries since it's all fast-paced, meaning I could do 12 deliveries in a few hours with 3 other drivers (this was at a slow store) so I'd come home with 30-50 bucks for a few hours of driving. (Though I had a V8 and got 13mpg so it all went to my tank) I wouldn't do it again. Not with my car. Management was good, but I rubbed them the wrong way once and got fired.

"So, I got my last wisdom tooth removed Friday. Let me tell you about the time I got the others removed. When I was around 19, my wisdom teeth began coming in. They hurt, but that's normal. Except it became obvious after awhile they were impacted. I read online that if they're painful for more than 6 months, they're likely impacted and it's time to have them removed. When I told my mom this, she rolled her eyes and said, ""They'll come in. Believe me, your mouth is big enough."" That's right. She thought the fact that I was mouthy had anything to do with whether or not there was room for my wisdom teeth. Well, I knew they were impacted, but I was still in high school at this point and didn't work, so it wasn't like I could pay to have them taken out. Two years passed. I had various infections where my teeth were trying to come in and lots of swelling, but they always went away at some point and I was still having trouble finding a job, so I just left them there. I tried to tell my mom how much trouble they were causing me, but she kept saying wisdom teeth are painful and she wasn't paying to have them removed when ""nothing was wrong."" Well, one day three of them got infected at once. The pain was so intense that I couldn't so much as move my tongue without pain radiating from my teeth to my ears to my throat. I drooled into a towel instead of swallowing my saliva. It's to this day the worst pain I've ever felt. At this time my dad took me to the dentist, FINALLY. Mom was still insisting this was normal, BTW. The dentist was shocked to see how long we let the problem go without seeing anyone about it. The removal was painful as hell (they couldn't get the infection to go away before operating, so they had to do it while my gums were inflamed). The dentist said my last remaining wisdom tooth wasn't impacted and it would come in. He turned out to be wrong, but at least I had 3 of the 4 removed. Who doesn't mind seeing their kid in extreme pain to save on dentist bills? That's my mother!"	so i got my last wisdom tooth removed friday let me tell you about the time i got the others removed when i was around my wisdom teeth began coming in they hurt but that s normal except it became obvious after awhile they were impacted i read online that if they re painful for more than months they re likely impacted and it s time to have them removed when i told my mom this she rolled her eyes and said they ll come in believe me your mouth is big enough that s right she thought the fact that i was had anything to do with whether or not there was room for my wisdom teeth well i knew they were impacted but i was still in high school at this point and didn t work so it wasn t like i could pay to have them taken out two years passed i had various infections where my teeth were trying to come in and lots of swelling but they always went away at some point and i was still having trouble finding a job so i just left them there i tried to tell my mom how much trouble they were causing me but she kept saying wisdom teeth are painful and she wasn t paying to have them removed when nothing was wrong well one day three of them got infected at once the pain was so intense that i couldn t so much as move my tongue without pain radiating from my teeth to my ears to my throat i drooled into a towel instead of swallowing my saliva it s to this day the worst pain i ve ever felt at this time my dad took me to the dentist finally mom was still insisting this was normal btw the dentist was shocked to see how long we let the problem go without seeing anyone about it the removal was painful as hell they couldn t get the infection to go away before operating so they had to do it while my gums were inflamed the dentist said my last remaining wisdom tooth wasn t impacted and it would come in he turned out to be wrong but at least i had of the removed who doesn t mind seeing their kid in extreme pain to save on dentist bills ? that s my mother ! 	-0.145	0.6335	402	1

Maybe not the worst, but the episode of House where he gets 13 from jail. They were treating a guy and eventually his wife as well once they found her in their messy house. They figured out she was the hoarder and had mental issues, then they found out she had miscarriages. *Somehow* they concluded she had ehlers-danlos syndrome and that was the end of it. Ehlers-Danlos is a rare, complex, and incredibly interesting disease with all kinds of variation. They could have done all kinds of interesting things. EDS can cause miscarriages, but that is not even a major symptom. And it doesn't help the reputation of the disease that all it explained was the miscarriage and mental illness.

"My dad told me this story as I left for a summer camp that would be held in UNC Chapel Hill's dorms. He told me when he attended university he had three suitemates. One of them was never around as he took night classes. The other was my dads close friend and the fourth guy (Mike) was an ROTC nut. So the say the suites are set up is that there's French doors separating each suite and the French doors had giant windows which people usually covered with curtains or posters. So mike was OBSESSED with pushing the red button on a nuclear submarine so he could start a war, and he constantly told his suitemates this. He also got drunk every Friday night and went out to fight with black people, and this made my dad and his suitemates to never want to talk to the guy. One night Mike comes home wasted and bloody after a night of fighting and my dads like ""k cool whatever"". My dad goes to his room to study and out of nowhere Mike's hands punch through the window and grab my dad. He takes his lamp and throws it at mike and runs out into the hallway where a VERY intoxicated Mike then calls my (hispanic) dad a ""filthy nigger"" and tell him how he's going to ""gut him like a fish"". My dad bangs on the RA's door and begs him to let him in. The RA then calls campus police, and I shit you not, it took FOUR cops to hold him down. My dad said mike went to a mental institution the rest of the semester and when he came back he had totally forgotten (or pretended to forget) that he tried to kill my dad. What a great way to start off freshman year!"	my dad told me this story as i left for a summer camp that would be held in unc chapel hill s dorms he told me when he attended university he had three one of them was never around as he took night classes the other was my dads close friend and the fourth guy mike was an rotc nut so the say the suites are set up is that there s french doors separating each suite and the french doors had giant windows which people usually covered with curtains or posters so mike was obsessed with pushing the red button on a nuclear submarine so he could start a war and he constantly told his this he also got drunk every friday night and went out to fight with black people and this made my dad and his to never want to talk to the guy one night mike comes home wasted and bloody after a night of fighting and my dads like k cool whatever my dad goes to his room to study and out of nowhere mike s hands punch through the window and grab my dad he takes his lamp and throws it at mike and runs out into the hallway where a very intoxicated mike then calls my hispanic dad a filthy nigger and tell him how he s going to gut him like a fish my dad bangs on the ra s door and begs him to let him in the ra then calls campus police and i shit you not it took four cops to hold him down my dad said mike went to a mental institution the rest of the semester and when he came back he had totally forgotten or pretended to forget that he tried to kill my dad what a great way to start off freshman year ! 	-0.0977	0.5143	309	1

The Life and Death of an Amigarumi Elephant Earlier in the year I made an elephant for my newborn nephew. He was hands down the best amigarumi I had ever done: http://imgur.com/a/Sz1zZ. My Sister in Law and her husband loved him and they were sure that as he grew up, my nephew would love him too. However, my nephew was not a healthy baby. He was born with a very rare congenital bowel defect and was whisked off to intensive care the moment he was born. A few days after he came into the world, my husband and I met our newest family member and I was so excited to give him his little elephant. His mother gave him pride-of-place in my nephew's crib, nestled amongst the tubes and monitor wires near his tiny head. It was such a bittersweet sight, seeing my tiny nephew railing himself against the defect he was born with whilst cuddling with a toy that I made so lovingly for him. Unfortunately, like many stories, this one turned more bitter than sweet in the end. After a heroic 6 week long struggle for life, my nephew passed away. His parents were with him...and so was his elephant. The funeral was heartbreaking. My nephew's coffin was so tiny, and looked even smaller in my brother-in-laws arms as he carried it into the chapel. I almost couldn't bear it...until my sister in law told me not to worry, because his elephant was in there with him. He loved his elephant, she told me, and he will be taking it with him into the next world. She asked if I was ok with that, and through my tears I was able to tell her that nothing would cheer me up more than knowing he wasn't alone in there. I made that elephant for him, no matter what. My nephew was cremated the next day with his little elephant by his side. Although we are all now left with a gaping hole in our lives, I have at least found comfort in knowing that our special little fighter had something soft and loving with him til the end. Sorry for the feel trip guys, but I just wanted to share this story with people I knew would appreciate it and understand. Edit: Thanks everyone for your kind words. The pain of losing him hasn't lessened over time, but I am getting better at handling it.

Again from me over here I've got nothing but sympathy, it feels horrible to be uncomfortable and insecure about your body, or part of it. And, just like society places horrible pressure on women to look attractive, I do think it's sad that small peenies are *sometimes* the butt of a few jokes here and there. But I have to admit that, as someone who has dated guys with a range of penis sizes, I JUST DON'T CARE ABOUT PENIS SIZE. I'm also willing to bet that the majority of women don't either. Apart from the ones that are basically female versions of TRPers. Seriously, using your own bodily insecurities as fuel for a bitterness and AWALT rant, that is truly some next level self-improvement, nice job, guys /s	again from me over here i ve got nothing but sympathy it feels horrible to be uncomfortable and insecure about your body or part of it and just like society places horrible pressure on women to look attractive i do think it s sad that small are *sometimes* the butt of a few jokes here and there but i have to admit that as someone who has dated guys with a range of penis sizes i just don t care about penis size i m also willing to bet that the majority of women don t either apart from the ones that are basically female versions of trpers seriously using your own bodily insecurities as fuel for a bitterness and rant that is truly some next level self improvement nice job guys s 	-0.1356	0.5765	133	1

We have had a lot of these in my mum's backyard lately. They have been feeding on caterpillars and getting really fat while breeding (I keep finding lots of egg sacs near the spiders I find). I kill them when I see them but they mostly just try to run and hide in crevices. I always feel bad killing spiders because they are sorting out much worse insects in my backyard like flies. Still, they make me feel uncomfortable. I actually left a huntsman in my bedroom for a few days because I know they're pretty harmless but one day I walked into my room and it reared up and started running towards me. That was the end of our relationship.	we have had a lot of these in my mum s backyard lately they have been feeding on caterpillars and getting really fat while breeding i keep finding lots of egg sacs near the spiders i find i kill them when i see them but they mostly just try to run and hide in crevices i always feel bad killing spiders because they are sorting out much worse insects in my backyard like flies still they make me feel uncomfortable i actually left a huntsman in my bedroom for a few days because i know they re pretty harmless but one day i walked into my room and it reared up and started running towards me that was the end of our relationship 	-0.105	0.5374	123	1
Advice from just a kid maybe but, please listen to me on this; you need to take some time for yourself. Find someone that you trust to take care of your kids for a day or two, and go to the beach and just let the grief take you. Let it wash over you, let yourself experience it. Do what you have to do, cry, scream, break things - so long as you do not harm yourself (excessive drinking, drug use or self harm or probably not good ideas). I guarantee allowing yourself a moment to truly take the loss will help you be stronger for your children. Because the last thing you ever want is to break in front of them, and take it out on them. I watched this happen with my ex-girlfriend's mother, and the effect it had on my ex-girlfriend was terrible and caused a few lasting issues between them. Lastly. Take a breath. You can do this. You did childbirth, this is nothing. Stand tall and proud, and live the life that you know he would have wanted you to have. You are strong, and everyone here is rooting for you.	advice from just a kid maybe but please listen to me on this you need to take some time for yourself find someone that you trust to take care of your kids for a day or two and go to the beach and just let the grief take you let it wash over you let yourself experience it do what you have to do cry scream break things so long as you do not harm yourself excessive drinking drug use or self harm or probably not good ideas i guarantee allowing yourself a moment to truly take the loss will help you be stronger for your children because the last thing you ever want is to break in front of them and take it out on them i watched this happen with my ex girlfriend s mother and the effect it had on my ex girlfriend was terrible and caused a few lasting issues between them lastly take a breath you can do this you did childbirth this is nothing stand tall and proud and live the life that you know he would have wanted you to have you are strong and everyone here is rooting for you 	-0.1067	0.5782	198	1

Greenpeace argues for government intervention; she does not. If Greenpeace wanted the market for whale products to stop, outside of making whaling expeditions illegal or implementing a Pigouvian tax, they would have to change the demand for whaling products, which means getting people to vote with their dollar. Inherent in her argument is that there is a demand for women-positive games, which is to say that it would be profitable for a firm to produce media products that she would not need to critique or boycott. The responses are suggesting that if such an untapped market existed, the big companies would probably have already profited from it. So maybe the problem isn't evil, sexist game companies lying about how hard it is to animate female characters. Maybe the problem is that responsible suppliers can't afford to invest in socially conscious games because the demand is so far nonexistent.	greenpeace argues for government intervention she does not if greenpeace wanted the market for whale products to stop outside of making whaling expeditions illegal or implementing a tax they would have to change the demand for whaling products which means getting people to vote with their dollar inherent in her argument is that there is a demand for women positive games which is to say that it would be profitable for a firm to produce media products that she would not need to critique or boycott the responses are suggesting that if such an untapped market existed the big companies would probably have already profited from it so maybe the problem isn t evil sexist game companies lying about how hard it is to animate female characters maybe the problem is that responsible suppliers can t afford to invest in socially conscious games because the demand is so far nonexistent 	-0.166	0.3626	150	1

Well I have a friend with a band that was going on tour with her boyfriends band. I was needing to do something with my life and had just gotten out of a messy relationship. So my friend invited me to come along and sell their merch at their shows and then street perform with them when we got to the destination. (They had an amazing stand up bass player for tour but not once we got there.) The trip (US) was from the Pacific Northwest to New Orleans and we all made the trip in an old Chevy bluebird school bus. It was a crazy ride with tons of shows and all kinds of people we stayed with. There were a couple breakdowns and the transmission had to be replaced both times. Once for two weeks and when we finally left we immediately got stuck in a snowstorm. About 14 hours at a dead stop on the highway. So we drank whiskey and took naps. Oh and I peed on the road in front of the bus. Now my friends boyfriend is rather eccentric. He dresses like he's from the 20's and used to be in a popular circus sideshow. So he had some clown friends and that who's house we parked outside of. I ended up performing with the clowns as well as my friends band. That house had at least a dozen people living at it. One of them took an interest in me. It was winter and incredibly cold outside, and I was sleeping on the bus on a hard little bunk that was crammed right up against the ceiling, I could hardly turn over. It was so cold I slept in my snow suit. Then one of the guys in the house invited me to sleep in his bed. He kept hands to himself for weeks and was quite the gentleman. We have been together for a year and a half or so now. It looks like it won't survive much longer though due to shitty circumstances. But yeah. That's the extended answer.	well i have a friend with a band that was going on tour with her boyfriends band i was needing to do something with my life and had just gotten out of a messy relationship so my friend invited me to come along and sell their merch at their shows and then street perform with them when we got to the destination they had an amazing stand up bass player for tour but not once we got there the trip us was from the pacific northwest to new orleans and we all made the trip in an old chevy bluebird school bus it was a crazy ride with tons of shows and all kinds of people we stayed with there were a couple breakdowns and the transmission had to be replaced both times once for two weeks and when we finally left we immediately got stuck in a snowstorm about hours at a dead stop on the highway so we drank whiskey and took naps oh and i peed on the road in front of the bus now my friends boyfriend is rather eccentric he dresses like he s from the s and used to be in a popular circus sideshow so he had some clown friends and that who s house we parked outside of i ended up performing with the clowns as well as my friends band that house had at least a dozen people living at it one of them took an interest in me it was winter and incredibly cold outside and i was sleeping on the bus on a hard little bunk that was crammed right up against the ceiling i could hardly turn over it was so cold i slept in my snow suit then one of the guys in the house invited me to sleep in his bed he kept hands to himself for weeks and was quite the gentleman we have been together for a year and a half or so now it looks like it won t survive much longer though due to shitty circumstances but yeah that s the extended answer 	-0.0814	0.314	351	1

To your point about worship counting, is this, let's say god exist and even though as a non believer you are not sure about the existence of god but worship anyway this would of course be seen as a moral act by god, what would you define this as immoral? wBut again this is a slippery slope and we could both hang on technicalities and interpretations but once you start hanging on mental actions that could not be proven, it can't be proven for me to say the opposite and cancel your argument out. But I don't see a point in that direction, but again if you want to proceed with this in a proven, not directly canceling out, action I'm open to that direction. You are confusing maturing with evolving. A person can lose their maturity at any given moment, see Donald's trump recent statements. I'm talking about evolving. A collective human evolution has taken place that doesn't go backwards, we are not turning back into apes, same thing with morality. It doesn't go backward it has evolved with time in the same way.

Plenty of morbidly obese people jump start their weight loss with doctor-supervised diets with crazy low calories. That's just what your diet is, doctor supervised. Your doctor isn't an idiot, he is highly educated in metabolic disorders and he suggested it for a reason. Whether it be because your BMR is lower due to PCOS (see below) or as a means to reduce your stomach size and make you fuller faster, I would personally take his advice. [Also, there have been studies performed on PCOS's effect on BMR, and it has been shown that women with PCOS and insulin resistance have a BMR lower than the average non PCOS/IR woman by as much as 700 calories.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18678372) So if an average woman burns 1800 calories/day at your weight, you may actually only burn 1100 calories/day.	i m going to disagree with everyone here about the calories if your doctor suggested that low i say go for it plenty of morbidly obese people jump start their weight loss with doctor supervised diets with crazy low calories that s just what your diet is doctor supervised your doctor isn t an idiot he is highly educated in metabolic disorders and he suggested it for a reason whether it be because your bmr is lower due to pcos see below or as a means to reduce your stomach size and make you fuller faster i would personally take his advice also there have been studies performed on pcos s effect on bmr and it has been shown that women with pcos and insulin resistance have a bmr lower than the average non pcos ir woman by as much as calories so if an average woman burns calories day at your weight you may actually only burn calories day 	-0.1332	0.2907	160	1
As far as I can tell this is a private company so he has no shareholders to impress.

Nix Uotan? Final Crisis made him a human vessel through with the Overmonitor can see the unified reality, which has since split again so he's really unknown as far as the New 52 is concerned. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe he's been mentioned since Final Crisis. If he were, he'd win; you're absolutely right. He has all the answers to guys like Superman and The Flash. As for Captain Atom, I'm not convinced he could take Superman or The Flash. Although Captain Atom can create insane amounts of power and even transmute matter, he also absorbs energy, which means Superman or The Flash could overwhelm him until he's unstable, reaches critical, and he self-destructs. If he can transmute the entire battle arena or at least a lot of it into Kryptonite, that would be one way he could gain an advantage over Superman, but I don't know what he could do against The Flash. I'd see The Flash whipping up some Speed Force nonsense, Captain Atom overloads and explodes, The Flash contains it, and we have a winner. I'd also question Captain Atom's abilities against Shazam. He doesn't really have any defense against magic.	nix ? final crisis made him a human vessel through with the can see the unified reality which has since split again so he s really unknown as far as the new is concerned someone correct me if i m wrong but i don t believe he s been mentioned since final crisis if he were he d win you re absolutely right he has all the answers to guys like superman and the flash as for captain atom i m not convinced he could take superman or the flash although captain atom can create insane amounts of power and even transmute matter he also absorbs energy which means superman or the flash could overwhelm him until he s unstable reaches critical and he self if he can transmute the entire battle arena or at least a lot of it into kryptonite that would be one way he could gain an advantage over superman but i don t know what he could do against the flash i d see the flash whipping up some speed force nonsense captain atom and explodes the flash contains it and we have a winner i d also question captain atom s abilities against shazam he doesn t really have any defense against magic 	0.0081	0.184	209	0

"But a friend of mine who is a psychologist said that one of her clients actually suffered traumatic flashbacks because of that scene. And it makes me so sick to my stomach to think that even if I did express this to these people, that at least one person was forced to relive one of the worst experiences of her life because DD just couldn't resist adding in another pointless rape scene, reddit still wouldn't give a shit, because lol triggers and lol only war veterans get ptsd. And it sucks for that client. It truly does. But GOT is known for its violence and sex. It's a very adult show, as anyone who has watched 5 seasons of it would know by now. It isn't up to the writers to cater to people who have sensitivities. Chances are there is someone who would be triggered by anything violent shown. Hell, I'm sometimes triggered by ""Roseanne"" because Dan and Roseanne's loud fights remind me of my parents' fights, nights of hearing my dad tear the house down in anger, and crying myself to sleep as a child. But the writers had no responsibility to cater to me. If you know something it bound to have aspects that upset you, don't watch it or at least wait for a summary. Also whoever said rape victims don't get PTSD? You must be confusing that with when we make fun of people who say they got PTSD because some asshole wolf whistled at them.

"Yes, since earthquakes are basically tectonic plates moving around. I'm sorry I'm terrible with but I'm worse at explaining with real words. So think of to this way. You are stuck in a room with 30 people, all cramped up. You cannot move at all. Everyone seems relatively okay with this situation, except you. You cannot handle it anymore, so you move a little to the left because you felt like the person to your right was way to squished against you. That causes your neighbor to your left feel uncomfortable, then she moves. Then everyone moves until everyone feels relatively comfortable again. Same with earthquakes. Usually, they are demonstration of ""release of seismic stress"". When one area has release its ""stress"", maybe at another place, the stress has risen, which could lead to another earthquake."	yes since earthquakes are basically tectonic plates moving around i m sorry i m terrible with but i m worse at explaining with real words so think of to this way you are stuck in a room with people all cramped up you cannot move at all everyone seems relatively okay with this situation except you you cannot handle it anymore so you move a little to the left because you felt like the person to your right was way to squished against you that causes your neighbor to your left feel uncomfortable then she moves then everyone moves until everyone feels relatively comfortable again same with earthquakes usually they are demonstration of release of seismic stress when one area has release its stress maybe at another place the stress has risen which could lead to another earthquake 	-0.1117	0.515	138	1

Wow you caught that fast... there isn't even an edit star. I do the same thing in public when people talk. If there is the tiniest mistake or stutter, I quickly point it out before they have a chance to remedy the error. Everyone else always claps in approval when I do this. I type with one hand because I'm missing part of my dominant hand. My hand has to move fast so I often make mistakes. Thank you for pointing out another one of what I'm sure will be ripe future of errors.	wow you caught that fast there isn t even an edit star i do the same thing in public when people talk if there is the tiniest mistake or stutter i quickly point it out before they have a chance to remedy the error everyone else always claps in approval when i do this i type with one hand because i m missing part of my dominant hand my hand has to move fast so i often make mistakes thank you for pointing out another one of what i m sure will be ripe future of errors 	0.1259	0.427	97	0

Probably a couple weeks ago when I was solo'ing the second Rosh as Troll while the rest of my team was fighting 4v5 mid lane. I was so focused on getting to the fight as soon as possible to shift the fight in our favor as a Troll with two lives that as soon as Rosh died I Phase Boots'd my hardest to get there, ran in like Rambo and unleashed everything I had.

I'm 26, i've 'started afresh' a few times, left my controlling much older husband when i was 20, then left an abusive partner.

YES! that's exactly it, i've always felt weak, because of my childhood, i build myself up and i'm this strong independent person. Then i got depressed and tried to kill myself, now i feel so broken and weak, i hate how my boyfriend looks at me sometimes. I hate people knowing i'm struggling. He says i'm the powerful one in the relationship, i wear the trousers. He told me he wasn't strong enough to deal with how depressed i was. So now i'm starting to feel so low again i'm scared, he's not strong enough for this and can't handle it, so what do i do? i don't want to lose him, but i can't look after myself and someone else too.

Thank you for that. I think the hardest thing has been, after having the diagnosis explained to me and what the symptoms are, I had this epiphany-type moment where I went back through all the shit that has gone on in my life and, with the revelation of this disorder, realizing that every single episode was caused by me and me alone. My entire understanding of my past and my friendships has been completely flipped, and it makes me sick to think of the things I have done to people because I thought they deserved it, how I pushed people away and yet expected them to come back and save me. I'm so deathly afraid of the road ahead. Its bittersweet in a sense because for once in my entire life I have an understanding of the chaos that is inside me, but at the moment I can't see it changing or getting better (even though, logically, I know it can).	thank you for that i think the hardest thing has been after having the diagnosis explained to me and what the symptoms are i had this epiphany type moment where i went back through all the shit that has gone on in my life and with the revelation of this disorder realizing that every single episode was caused by me and me alone my entire understanding of my past and my friendships has been completely flipped and it makes me sick to think of the things i have done to people because i thought they deserved it how i pushed people away and yet expected them to come back and save me i m so deathly afraid of the road ahead its bittersweet in a sense because for once in my entire life i have an understanding of the chaos that is inside me but at the moment i can t see it changing or getting better even though logically i know it can 	-0.0835	0.5262	164	1

Could you please break that wall up with a few paragraphs? In any case: I don't consider it a slip-up to drink some alcohol after a long enough abstinence, e.g. months, as long as this remains a single incident. Of course that is quite the key problem for some. I'm saying that as long as a person has to fear to ever drink a glass or two of hard liquor ever again, the person might be safe - but the person isn't free. It should be possible to rise above that and develop a will that can freely choose.	could you please break that wall up with a few paragraphs ? in any case i don t consider it a slip up to drink some alcohol after a long enough abstinence e g months as long as this remains a single incident of course that is quite the key problem for some i m saying that as long as a person has to fear to ever drink a glass or two of hard liquor ever again the person might be safe but the person isn t free it should be possible to rise above that and develop a will that can freely choose 	0.0451	0.222	104	0

Then stupid me looked up the drug interactions between my meds and Lortab and now I'm freaking out. I keep trying to tell myself if there were any danger my surgeon wouldn't have prescribed Lortab or told me to keep taking my meds but of course my inner voice is not helping.

My first ""girlfriend"" (although she'd probably say otherwise since the relationship was so short) once saw a good-looking girl around my age working the register while we were shopping for clothes. The girl I was with knew that I have no qualms about making small talk with hot women in public, so we had this doozy of a conversation: * Her: Don't talk to that cashier when we get to the counter. * Me: And what if I do? * Her: Then I might have to cut her eyes out. * Me: O_O... So of course, when we got to the front, I talked to her anyway. I didn't flirt-- I was just making small talk. ""Hey, how are you,"" that sort of thing. I even made her laugh when I remarked about Mondays being terrible or something or another. Anyway, the girl I was with leaned up and whispered in my ear, harshly, ""What did I tell you?"" I didn't say anything. I was laughing hard on the inside, though. Then I decided to give her a test, since I knew she wasn't one for public displays of affection: * Me: Put your arm around me. * Her: ... no. * Me: Do it, or I'm gonna start talking to her again.

I wasn't looking to have to have 2+ screens open at all time just to play a single game, so I kinda lost interest and stopped playing. So, I just wanted to check in on the status of the game. First, is there more content, or a better story yet? Or is Rasputin still a seemingly major plot point that is instantly forgotten the instant you leave earth? Does the dude in the Tower now tell you about all of the things he says he COULD tell you about? Second, is playing the same strikes over and over and over still being masqueraded as content, or have they actually added real beefy content? Third, have they added any kind of matchmaking to raids to allow players who aren't in clans/guilds to actually have a chance at seeing the content? Fourth, have they made drop rates any better on blue and better gear so I don't have to run the same strikes/crucible matches 100 times a week to progress in the game? Fifth, is RNG still as big of a PITA? Sixth and last - can I finally talk to people for matchmaking? Or do I still have to rely on outside sources like destinylfg for something that should have been included in-game in the first place (based on the feedback received in both alpha and beta)? Maybe these seem a bit snarky, but they really killed my enjoyment of this game and I'd genuinely like to know if they've been addressed.	i haven t played for awhile so i haven t played destiny for close to a month i played through the single player and ran through each of the strikes i m not part of a guild or clan or anything and due to lack of ability to really communicate meaningfully in game i couldn t find one in the game i wasn t looking to have to have screens open at all time just to play a single game so i kinda lost interest and stopped playing so i just wanted to check in on the status of the game first is there more content or a better story yet ? or is rasputin still a seemingly major plot point that is instantly forgotten the instant you leave earth ? does the dude in the tower now tell you about all of the things he says he could tell you about ? second is playing the same strikes over and over and over still being as content or have they actually added real beefy content ? third have they added any kind of matchmaking to raids to allow players who aren t in clans guilds to actually have a chance at seeing the content ? fourth have they made drop rates any better on blue and better gear so i don t have to run the same strikes crucible matches times a week to progress in the game ? fifth is rng still as big of a pita ? sixth and last can i finally talk to people for matchmaking ? or do i still have to rely on outside sources like for something that should have been included in game in the first place based on the feedback received in both alpha and beta ? maybe these seem a bit snarky but they really killed my enjoyment of this game and i d genuinely like to know if they ve been addressed 	0.0332	0.4708	324	0

A liberal muslim homosexual ACLU lawyer professor and abortion doctor was teaching a class on Karl Marx, known atheist Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Marx and accept that he was the most highly-evolved being the world has ever known, even greater than Jesus Christ! At this moment, a brave, patriotic, pro-life Navy SEAL champion who had served 1500 tours of duty and understood the necessity of war and fully supported all military decision made by the United States stood up and held up a rock. How old is this rock, pinhead? The arrogant professor smirked quite Jewishly and smugly replied 4.6 billion years, you stupid Christian Wrong. Its been 5,000 years since God created it. If it was 4.6 billion years old and evolution, as you say, is real then it should be an animal now The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Origin of the Species. He stormed out of the room crying those liberal crocodile tears. The same tears liberals cry for the poor (who today live in such luxury that most own refrigerators) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the deserving job creators. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, DeShawn Washington, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a sophist liberal professor. He wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them! The students applauded and all registered Republican that day and accepted Jesus as their lord and savior. An eagle named Small Government flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The pledge of allegiance was read several times, and God himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country. The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the gay plague AIDS and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity.

It is a valid argument, for one simple reason. If you try and stop me from commenting because I *could* post a link to child porn, then you are in the wrong. If you try and stop me from commenting because I *actually* post a link to child porn, then you are taking a correct action. Removing free speech and expression because of a hypothetical is never appropriate. How does this factor into your question? You postulated that they only removed your link, and the subverse that it was posted on, because of what it means to their bottom line, and not because of any moral reason. And again, I ask... Isn't that enough? If they start banning people for *moral* reasons, then we'll start seeing bans of unpopular subjects like /v/atheism, /v/christianity, /v/politics, /v/libertarianism, or other subs that one person or another finds objectionable. By only banning people when it becomes *legally necessary*, they protect persons like yourself while allowing the average, law-abiding user to spout out whatever shit they want.	it is a valid argument for one simple reason if you try and stop me from commenting because i *could* post a link to child porn then you are in the wrong if you try and stop me from commenting because i *actually* post a link to child porn then you are taking a correct action removing free speech and expression because of a hypothetical is never appropriate how does this factor into your question ? you postulated that they only removed your link and the subverse that it was posted on because of what it means to their bottom line and not because of any moral reason and again i ask isn t that enough ? if they start banning people for reasons then we ll start seeing bans of unpopular subjects like v atheism v christianity v politics v libertarianism or other subs that one person or another finds objectionable by only banning people when it becomes legally necessary they protect persons like yourself while allowing the average law abiding user to spout out whatever shit they want 	-0.0483	0.291	180	0

I went to a mega church in CA not too long ago with family who are trying to open my eyes to faith. I was willing to see what it was all about. Just sharing a little about my experience. [Was greeted at the door with one of these, wafer on top, grape juice on bottom](http://www.imgur.com/5YHjMWd.jpeg) [This place isn't exactly a humble place of worship](http://www.imgur.com/Xo6Dmtp.jpeg). Looks like it takes quite a bit of money to produce this setup... and those single-serve communion cups. Get in and sit down, the first 35 min is a small, young, rock band singing faith songs. Everyone with hands in the air, really pretending to feel this lame music. Then we finally have someone preaching. But he never opens a bible or tells us to open ours. He just starts telling us anecdotal stories and his own interpretations of stories from the bible. When the collection plate passed me, I noticed it was all checks, no one gives paper money anymore, let alone change. Towards the end, the preacher kept reminding us repeatedly to join some workshops next month, not free of course. No thanks. I just remember church when I was a child as being humble. All we ever did was read from the bible and sing together. No one had to hand over their paychecks. Now it has just turned into this business, that is so disgusting I couldn't stand being there. I've been an atheist for the majority of my life now, but seeing that first hand just blew my asshole off.	i went to a mega church in ca not too long ago with family who are trying to open my eyes to faith i was willing to see what it was all about just sharing a little about my experience was greeted at the door with one of these wafer on top grape juice on bottom this place isn t exactly a humble place of worship looks like it takes quite a bit of money to produce this setup and those single serve communion cups get in and sit down the first min is a small young rock band singing faith songs everyone with hands in the air really pretending to feel this lame music then we finally have someone preaching but he never opens a bible or tells us to open ours he just starts telling us anecdotal stories and his own interpretations of stories from the bible when the collection plate passed me i noticed it was all checks no one gives paper money anymore let alone change towards the end the preacher kept reminding us repeatedly to join some workshops next month not free of course no thanks i just remember church when i was a child as being humble all we ever did was read from the bible and sing together no one had to hand over their paychecks now it has just turned into this business that is so disgusting i couldn t stand being there i ve been an atheist for the majority of my life now but seeing that first hand just blew my asshole off 	-0.033	0.1847	263	0

I do not approve of 25% of anime, no. It's perverted And I don't know what happened in Batman. In what way was this represented? Was the kid shot like you would shoot a deer while hunting? Probably not. So it's something else. I specifically chose GTA V as an example because you can shoot anyone you wish, for no reason. And there are no kids in this game. Wonder why? It's just an opinion. Kids should not be presented in perverted situations. If you think otherwise, I don't understand you. Maybe you care less about children than I do.

Question regarding scene at the end of Arlington Road (spoilers) So I just watched Arlington Road for the first time last night. Overall I enjoyed the movie and think I understand pretty much everything that happened. I just have 1 question though. At the end of the movie, how does the bomb get into the trunk of Jeff Bridges rental car? Did Tim Robbins know which car he was going to get and had it planted in the trunk beforehand? Because I believe the only scene where Jeff Bridges isn't in the car is when he's fighting Tim Robbins in the warehouse building. But I doubt that would have been when they planted it in the car.	question regarding scene at the end of arlington road spoilers so i just watched arlington road for the first time last night overall i enjoyed the movie and think i understand pretty much everything that happened i just have question though at the end of the movie how does the bomb get into the trunk of jeff bridges rental car ? did tim robbins know which car he was going to get and had it planted in the trunk beforehand ? because i believe the only scene where jeff bridges isn t in the car is when he s fighting tim robbins in the warehouse building but i doubt that would have been when they planted it in the car 	0.1714	0.49	120	0

its a really hard game to get in to because of the learning curve. It's a really hard game to get GOOD at because of the learning curve.

However, you're going to be in games because of matchmaking with players who are usually equally as terrible, so in theory it should balance out, and you'll have the occasional games where you do really well in comparison to the nine other players in the lobby.	its a really hard game to get in to because of the learning curve it s a really hard game to get good at because of the learning curve i had zero moba experience when i started playing dota but i was hooked instantly you need to accept the fact that you re going to suck for a while if that turns you off then dota isn t for you however you re going to be in games because of matchmaking with players who are usually equally as terrible so in theory it should balance out and you ll have the occasional games where you do really well in comparison to the nine other players in the lobby 	-0.1608	0.578	118	1

[Ch. 64 spoilers] At this point, there are only two possibilities that make sense. Either Rod is a lying piece of scum, or RBA, Eren's father and Kenny were all hasty ignorant fools. All of them went to such great lengths to acquire the 'Reiss power', not knowing that it can only be used by people from the Reiss bloodline? RBA wasted half a decade of their lives and indirectly killed thousands of people just to acquire that power, without knowing that? Eren's father gave his own life to give that power to Eren, without knowing that it could only be used by the Reiss? I refuse to believe it. I'm sure it's not everyone that can fully use that power, but I would also be extremely surprised if it was ONLY the Reiss people who can do so. Grisha MIGHT've been a fool who didn't know, but I'm sure RBA knew that they couldn't use it themselves... that's why they wanted to bring Eren along instead of just eating him and taking the power for themselves. Furthermore, in chapter 50 Reiner and Berthold looked like they had seen that power being used before. So, unless the Reiss have relatives who live outside the walls, there's no way Rod is telling the truth. Also, in Norse mythology, the giant who builds the walls of Asgard doesn't do it just to 'give peace to humanity'. There has to be a whole lot more to this story than just what Rod tells Historia.	ch spoilers at this point there are only two possibilities that make sense either rod is a lying piece of scum or rba eren s father and kenny were all hasty ignorant fools all of them went to such great lengths to acquire the reiss power not knowing that it can only be used by people from the reiss bloodline ? rba wasted half a decade of their lives and indirectly killed thousands of people just to acquire that power without knowing that ? eren s father gave his own life to give that power to eren without knowing that it could only be used by the reiss ? i refuse to believe it i m sure it s not everyone that can fully use that power but i would also be extremely surprised if it was only the reiss people who can do so grisha might ve been a fool who didn t know but i m sure rba knew that they couldn t use it themselves that s why they wanted to bring eren along instead of just eating him and taking the power for themselves furthermore in chapter reiner and berthold looked like they had seen that power being used before so unless the reiss have relatives who live outside the walls there s no way rod is telling the truth also in norse mythology the giant who builds the walls of asgard doesn t do it just to give peace to humanity there has to be a whole lot more to this story than just what rod tells historia 	0.13	0.0	263	0

Yup, for some people a simplified routine works and for others it doesn't. It's not really helpful to say that people overcomplicate their skincare.

For me, I never had huge issues with my skin other than mild acne. The products I use now have seriously improved my skin's texture and my face just feels so much better. If you look at my posts my skincare regime is quite long. Skincare is a mixed bag. It's frustrating when a simplified routine works for someone and not for others!

We recently had our headlamps replaced in our Toyota 4WD with some crappy ones when they broke. I don't think they were a genuine part, or they were 2nd hand. We drive about a 6-8hr drive (each way) at least 2 times a year in winter to go down south on highways and so we have to drive part of the way at night usually (cause we are slow getting away). The high beam on the old headlamps was really bad - I nearly hit a few dead kangaroos because of this. We got them replaced again with brand new ones after some scary driving experiences and it was HEAPS better - I could see at least 10 times as far. Didn't need HID lights, and I don't know why anyone really would need them.

My 18-year-old cat was put down. I am feeling guilt for not holding her during. She had cancer for a little while, but blood in her urine told us it spread to her bladder, so we decided it was time to put her down. So I was there in the office with her, crying my eyes out. The vet said I could hold her, or just put her on the table and pet her. I felt absolute dread at the thought of her going limp in my arms. I was barely holding up as was and I was afraid that would make me lose it. It was taking all my strength to be there at all. My sister had offered to take her in so I wouldn't have to, but I was determined to be there in her last moments. So I rubbed her back as she was euthanized. Now I am extremely sorry I didn't hold her. I know she didn't know she was about to die. She only knew she was in a place where she had been before and I was petting her. She passed away peacefully feeling me pet her back. I know even if I had held her I would find something else to be upset about, but I can't shake the feeling that I wasn't properly there for her.	my year old cat was put down i am feeling guilt for not holding her during she had cancer for a little while but blood in her urine told us it spread to her bladder so we decided it was time to put her down so i was there in the office with her crying my eyes out the vet said i could hold her or just put her on the table and pet her i felt absolute dread at the thought of her going limp in my arms i was barely holding up as was and i was afraid that would make me lose it it was taking all my strength to be there at all my sister had offered to take her in so i wouldn t have to but i was determined to be there in her last moments so i rubbed her back as she was euthanized now i am extremely sorry i didn t hold her i know she didn t know she was about to die she only knew she was in a place where she had been before and i was petting her she passed away peacefully feeling me pet her back i know even if i had held her i would find something else to be upset about but i can t shake the feeling that i wasn t properly there for her 	-0.0999	0.4844	231	1

Marissa Alexander's case. Not MR really, but could be related. http://loop21.com/life/marissa-alexander-stand-your-ground-against-black-people The article is about the stand your ground law and the controversy surrounding it and Trayvon Martin's murder, but I'm posting it here as a gender issue. What happened to Marissa here is something we usually attribute to men: She was in an abusive relationship, fired a gun into the ceiling to scare off her husband who she said threatened to kill her and began to charge her, and is now in jail because her husband claimed she tried shooting at him and his children(from another marriage). I thought I'd post this because it's another case of the wrong person being arrested in a domestic abuse case, even if it's the woman in this case. I can see having her in custody for awhile since she supposedly fired a gun at someone, but why not her husband too? He has a history of domestic violence, and threatened murder.	marissa alexander s case not mr really but could be related the article is about the stand your ground law and the controversy surrounding it and trayvon martin s murder but i m posting it here as a gender issue what happened to marissa here is something we usually attribute to men she was in an abusive relationship fired a gun into the ceiling to scare off her husband who she said threatened to kill her and began to charge her and is now in jail because her husband claimed she tried shooting at him and his children from another marriage i thought i d post this because it s another case of the wrong person being arrested in a domestic abuse case even if it s the woman in this case i can see having her in custody for awhile since she supposedly fired a gun at someone but why not her husband too ? he has a history of domestic violence and threatened murder 	-0.0929	0.5496	166	1

"Our trading block is with the EU, they are the body through which we make trade agreements with the rest of the world. So, no, there isn't more to the world than the EU where trade is concerned. But the most important questions underlying the debate are ""How can you have free trade for business without a similarly free labour market for people?"" and ""How can you hope to compete economically with Russia, China, US Canada, and the BRIC countries standing alone?"" Farage's answer is to close all borders to people, allow the businesses to do what they like, and hope our products are so good people will demand them and we don't lose the inevitable trade wars. UKIP would like to close our borders and vet everyone who comes through against a points system - no other country does this or can do this, not even Australia - a country that has a half a dozen different immigration systems.

My calorie-counting habits are impacting my life negatively, but I don't know really know how to stop. What should I do? I posted this in r/relationships, but didn't really get the help I was looking for. So I'm posting here. I figured, here I'm probably more likely to find people who have had similar experiences. So here goes: Basically, the TL;DR version of this post is that I have a compulsive need for counting all the calories that I eat, every meal and every day. I know my anxiety is not rational, that not counting calories all the time isn't that big of a deal, but not knowing how many calories what I eat contains causes me anxiety and extreme discomfort. It started when I was 15. Back then, I was playing football, and my coach had told the team that, in order to get more muscular and stronger, we needed to eat in surplus. I really wanted to succeed, so I started learning about nutrition, asked my mom to buy me a food scale and started calorie-counting and weighting all my food. When I was in my last year of high school, an injury pretty much ended my chances of playing in college, so I quit. But by then, counting calories and lifting weights had become a habit, so I started doing bodybuilding instead. Around this time, I was spending a lot of time reading 'bro science' on the internet and I quickly realized that calorie-counting could be applied not just to getting more muscular and stronger, but also to all aspects of one's physique: to prepare for a running competition, to get bigger and stronger, to cut down on fat, etc.. Around that time, I became quite a bit of a nutrition junkie. I started reading on actual research on nutrition and health and all that stuff. I always thought calorie-counting was a good habit, and it never was a problem. But I'm almost 21 now, and all my friends are teasing me about the fact that I've never really had a girlfriend, that I never really talk about girls as more than friends or acquaintances. Because of that, a couple months ago I started socializing more, I started getting out there so as to increase my chances of meeting someone that I get along with. The problem is, socializing involves eating without being able to calorie-count all the time, and that prospect causes me extreme mental discomfort. I realized that only recently. For example, 2 weeks ago, my family was having a family meeting at a restaurant, and I didn't go because I was afraid of the anxiety eating food that I couldn't calorie-count would cause me. Also, 2 days ago, I was gonna ask out one of my classmates in college, but I backed out at the last second because I realized that any part of the date that involved eating somewhere would cause me to feel unwell. Like I said, I know it's not rational. I know that if you calorie-count like 80% of the time, you are fine. But not being able to know how many calories are contained in what I eat causes me anxiety. Also, I find the stuff that they serve in most restaurants and fast food chains to be disgusting, and I don't tell people because I'm scared that they'll think I'm weird or something. Personally, I rarely eat anything other than chicken, brown rice, sweet potatoes, eggs, nuts and lettuce. And my parents think that it's 'not normal' but I pay for my own food for the most part, so they can't really have a say in what I eat. I've realized that my calorie-counting habit, no matter how good it is, has started to impact my social life negatively in various ways, and I don't know what to do about it. I don't know how to stop, and that is causing me almost as much anxiety as not being able to count calories, so I'm stuck in vicious circle of anxiety that I don't really know how to escape. Edit : I've read all the comments so far. Thanks for the amazing support. I'm not too sure what to say. I'll re-edit when I am.	my calorie counting habits are impacting my life negatively but i don t know really know how to stop what should i do ? i posted this in r relationships but didn t really get the help i was looking for so i m posting here i figured here i m probably more likely to find people who have had similar experiences so here goes basically the tl dr version of this post is that i have a compulsive need for counting all the calories that i eat every meal and every day i know my anxiety is not rational that not counting calories all the time isn t that big of a deal but not knowing how many calories what i eat contains causes me anxiety and extreme discomfort it started when i was back then i was playing football and my coach had told the team that in order to get more muscular and stronger we needed to eat in surplus i really wanted to succeed so i started learning about nutrition asked my mom to buy me a food scale and started calorie counting and weighting all my food when i was in my last year of high school an injury pretty much ended my chances of playing in college so i quit but by then counting calories and lifting weights had become a habit so i started doing bodybuilding instead around this time i was spending a lot of time reading bro science on the internet and i quickly realized that calorie counting could be applied not just to getting more muscular and stronger but also to all aspects of one s physique to prepare for a running competition to get bigger and stronger to cut down on fat etc around that time i became quite a bit of a nutrition junkie i started reading on actual research on nutrition and health and all that stuff i always thought calorie counting was a good habit and it never was a problem but i m almost now and all my friends are teasing me about the fact that i ve never really had a girlfriend that i never really talk about girls as more than friends or acquaintances because of that a couple months ago i started socializing more i started getting out there so as to increase my chances of meeting someone that i get along with the problem is socializing involves eating without being able to calorie count all the time and that prospect causes me extreme mental discomfort i realized that only recently for example weeks ago my family was having a family meeting at a restaurant and i didn t go because i was afraid of the anxiety eating food that i couldn t calorie count would cause me also days ago i was gonna ask out one of my classmates in college but i backed out at the last second because i realized that any part of the date that involved eating somewhere would cause me to feel unwell like i said i know it s not rational i know that if you calorie count like of the time you are fine but not being able to know how many calories are contained in what i eat causes me anxiety also i find the stuff that they serve in most restaurants and fast food chains to be disgusting and i don t tell people because i m scared that they ll think i m weird or something personally i rarely eat anything other than chicken brown rice sweet potatoes eggs nuts and lettuce and my parents think that it s not normal but i pay for my own food for the most part so they can t really have a say in what i eat i ve realized that my calorie counting habit no matter how good it is has started to impact my social life negatively in various ways and i don t know what to do about it i don t know how to stop and that is causing me almost as much anxiety as not being able to count calories so i m stuck in vicious circle of anxiety that i don t really know how to escape edit i ve read all the comments so far thanks for the amazing support i m not too sure what to say i ll re edit when i am 	0.1323	0.4643	738	0
"Help me out redditors, a friend ran away from home and her mom is trying to press truancy/runaway charges to the police. Story inside, what is the worst that could happen to her? Basically it was Friday, their last day of school before winter break. She's 16 and she left after 2nd bell to go to a friend's house and get drunk. She was expecting to be back to school in time to catch the bus, but ended up getting really sick and got into an argument with her mom about not being home, resulting in her mom telling her NOT to come home, and that she doesn't want to ""see her face again"". So she stayed overnight at this friend's house, and went to another friend's house the next day to stay. Her parents are divorced, and apparently right now she is en route to her dad's while her mom is talking to the police about ""pressing charges"" for truancy and being a runaway. What I'm wondering is, what are the possible outcomes? If you're a runaway, I believe the police just take you back home right? If you're a truant, if all they do is hear about it, and don't catch you in the act, I'm assuming the only thing they will do is tell the school and let the school handle it, correct? And her mom currently doesn't know she was out drinking, but apparently an ex-boyfriend who heard about all this is spilling the beans to her mom and may tell her, so if the police find out about underage drinking what would result of that? And is the friend she drank with and stayed with, who is about to turn 18, in any danger of punishment?

My (20 F) wife (20 F) undermines me with my parents (58 F/60 M). If I have a disagreement with my parents about anything, my wife takes their side. She claims she hates confrontation and is trying to avoid a fight but she just makes me livid. Today, for instance, my sick and physically disabled mother was struggling to breathe. When asked if she needed to go to the hospital, she made up an excuse about insurance and not wanting to go. My wife said wait until Monday and then if she isn't better she will go.

My dog is very defensive on a leash since she was attacked by two dogs last year (requiring surgery, it was a big deal).

He was a bad diver in his day but the media only focused on Drogba and Ronaldo. There are many reasons why I can't stand Steven Gerrard, but the diving issue is number one for me. It's not so much that he dives per se, as unfortunately a lot of players do now. It's the fact that he had the absolute brass neck to spout all this hypocritical, sanctimonious bollocks in his autobiography and newspaper interviews about how diving was ruining the game, and that if he caught his team mates diving he'd 'have a word' etc. Fucking holier than thou arsehole.

Make it clear to him how big a deal this is to you, that it's making you question your future together. Tell him if something doesn't change that you cannot continue. Be prepared, if you guys stay together, to assume responsibility for things that CANNOT be forgotten (money, birth certificates, medical appointments, etc) You can work with him on setting schedules and routines, that should help with his forgetfulness a little bit. Chances are though, he's never going to be a super responsible person when it comes to physical items. Some people just can't do it. It doesn't mean he's a bad person and it doesn't mean that he would (automatically) be a bad father. I would speak with him, enforce the importance of the issue, and set a small goal. If he makes acceptable progress towards meeting that goal (acceptable to you) then continue. If he doesn't try or doesn't take it seriously then I would consider breaking things off with him. He cannot change this part of his personality overnight but if he is serious about yours and his relationship then he needs to make an effort.	make it clear to him how big a deal this is to you that it s making you question your future together tell him if something doesn t change that you cannot continue be prepared if you guys stay together to assume responsibility for things that cannot be forgotten money birth certificates medical appointments etc you can work with him on setting schedules and routines that should help with his forgetfulness a little bit chances are though he s never going to be a super responsible person when it comes to physical items some people just can t do it it doesn t mean he s a bad person and it doesn t mean that he would automatically be a bad father i would speak with him enforce the importance of the issue and set a small goal if he makes acceptable progress towards meeting that goal acceptable to you then continue if he doesn t try or doesn t take it seriously then i would consider breaking things off with him he cannot change this part of his personality overnight but if he is serious about yours and his relationship then he needs to make an effort 	-0.1664	0.458	198	1

the child has to say yes, that is my point. no child can make that decision, they have no reference point or understanding of what death entails or what it can do to those surrounding them. Which is why their parents have to be involved and they have to be assessed by doctors before euthanasia is allowed. You're acting like they're just killing kids who walk in and ask to be killed. The child isn't the only one who has to give consent. The parents and doctors do as well, and they *do* have the life experiences and knowledge to make that decision, especially the doctors who deal with terminally ill patients every day. The doctors know how bad off the children are when assessing them. a bureaucracy should not allow small children to choose to kill themselves as small children do not have the life experience that allows them to make a decision on that. it's simply absurd So just let them wallow in pain and agony until their terminal illness finally kills them even though a number of adults (many of whom care for patients and study terminal illness for a living) have to sign off on the euthanasia? *That* is absurd.	the child has to say yes that is my point no child can make that decision they have no reference point or understanding of what death entails or what it can do to those surrounding them which is why their parents have to be involved and they have to be assessed by doctors before euthanasia is allowed you re acting like they re just killing kids who walk in and ask to be killed the child isn t the only one who has to give consent the parents and doctors do as well and they *do* have the life experiences and knowledge to make that decision especially the doctors who deal with terminally ill patients every day the doctors know how bad off the children are when assessing them a bureaucracy should not allow small children to choose to kill themselves as small children do not have the life experience that allows them to make a decision on that it s simply absurd so just let them wallow in pain and agony until their terminal illness finally kills them even though a number of adults many of whom care for patients and study terminal illness for a living have to sign off on the euthanasia ? *that* is absurd 	-0.2	0.7376	209	1

I know this is probably a dumb question, but as someone who knows absolutely nothing about computers, what would be a better choice: buying a new gaming console, or taking the dive and building a pc? I know it's probably an obvious answer for most people, but for me it's not so obvious. I want a gaming pc, but I know nothing about computers or how they work. The task of building one seems unbelievably daunting. Even when I know what to get, putting it together and figuring it out seems beyond intimidating. Even if I did manage to put one together somehow, upgrading also seems intimidating. I don't have a lot of time for building one. The pros of just getting a console is that it's already made. It's simple. The cons? It's less powerful and a smaller library of games. The pros of building a pc? More powerful, more games and mods. The cons? Very time consuming and there are a lot of ways I could screw it up. What should I do based off of what I told you about me?	i know this is probably a dumb question but as someone who knows absolutely nothing about computers what would be a better choice buying a new gaming console or taking the dive and building a pc ? i know it s probably an obvious answer for most people but for me it s not so obvious i want a gaming pc but i know nothing about computers or how they work the task of building one seems unbelievably daunting even when i know what to get putting it together and figuring it out seems beyond intimidating even if i did manage to put one together somehow upgrading also seems intimidating i don t have a lot of time for building one the pros of just getting a console is that it s already made it s simple the cons ? it s less powerful and a smaller library of games the pros of building a pc ? more powerful more games and mods the cons ? very time consuming and there are a lot of ways i could screw it up what should i do based off of what i told you about me ? 	0.1465	0.531	195	0

Let us continue it now: Here is how foodpantry closed. This is right out of the mouths of the administrators: -------------------- [A] to /r/Assistance/ sent an hour ago Wanted to reach out and see if things have calmed down a bit. Since there seems to be some confusion, the head moderator at food_pantry demodded the others and shut the subreddit down. He or she sent the following modmail, which nobody saw since they were all demodded a few minutes later: Hi guys. It is with a hollow heart that I wish to announce that I will be closing /r/food_pantry down for good. The last 4 years has been one hell of an adventure. There have been so many people helped through this subreddit, but I can't in good conscience, sit around and wait for it to be corrupted by the admins. I watched /u/kickme444 [+1] grow an amazing community only for reddit to hijack it and turn it into the monstrosity it is now. What was once a wonderful community about giving to others within the community has turned into a circle jerk about bringing in money through the Reddit marketplace or promoting reddit through the world records. And it's not just redditgifts, reddit is not the site it was 4 years ago when I created this sub. All the censoring and shadiness... I would rather remember the sub that I created while it's still what I created, than what it could be if the admins decide to wedge their grubby hands on it and find some way of squeezing money out of her, while squeezing us out. I appreciate you all so much. I will forever look back on this time fondly 3 I hope you all understand my decision. The TL;DR is that there isn't any indication that you or anyone else had anything undue going on. The other mods there are probably just confused since all they know is they got demodded and the sub got closed. ----------------------- These are the words of the administrators.

Well it's better to get it pierced as a baby, even though it's not really the baby's choice. I got my ears pierced when I turned 11, and I got a terrible, terrible infection from it. Apparently it's very common with people of my race, but the scar actually grew out and it formed a little lump behind my ear. I'm glad it was behind my ears because it must have looked really awful. Fast forward a couple of years and it became pretty big, maybe the size of a blueberry, and I had it surgically removed. It cost my mother a ton, since it's considered plastic surgery so it was not covered by insurance. And the worst thing is, I got pierced by a professional at a fancy jewelry store (expensive), and we bought the best gold (expensive) in order to avoid any infections. But my curious self couldn't keep myself from touching my ears, and ... yeah. All of these expenses would have been avoided if I had my ears pierced as a baby. And, turns out, I don't even like earrings so really it was all a waste. I think if I were to live in a country where the majority of girls had their ears pierced, I'd pierce my daughters' ears when they're babies in case they choose to have earrings once they're older.	well it s better to get it pierced as a baby even though it s not really the baby s choice i got my ears pierced when i turned and i got a terrible terrible infection from it apparently it s very common with people of my race but the scar actually grew out and it formed a little lump behind my ear i m glad it was behind my ears because it must have looked really awful fast forward a couple of years and it became pretty big maybe the size of a blueberry and i had it surgically removed it cost my mother a ton since it s considered plastic surgery so it was not covered by insurance and the worst thing is i got pierced by a professional at a fancy jewelry store expensive and we bought the best gold expensive in order to avoid any infections but my curious self couldn t keep myself from touching my ears and yeah all of these expenses would have been avoided if i had my ears pierced as a baby and turns out i don t even like earrings so really it was all a waste i think if i were to live in a country where the majority of girls had their ears pierced i d pierce my daughters ears when they re babies in case they choose to have earrings once they re older 	-0.129	0.3731	237	1

http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1408390254 This game went 58 minutes, 3k MMR. I was Radiant. Dire absolutely stomped the early game and built early shadow blades on ganking heroes, making farming essentially impossible as they constantly inhabited our side of the map and took our towers one by one. Around 25 minutes we'd lost all outer towers. We didn't leave the base for the next 25 minutes. We turtled. Turtled so hard that our Silencer got an abandon even though he was completely playing. It wasn't fun. It was boring as shit. But every time they pushed high ground we repelled them. And then they made the mistake of getting caught in Rosh without buybacks by a smoke gank and we pushed down mid and won the game. It was stupid. We shouldn't have won at all. They're equally stupid for not building BKBs now that I actually look at it though. But still.	this game went minutes k mmr i was radiant dire absolutely stomped the early game and built early shadow blades on ganking heroes making farming essentially impossible as they constantly inhabited our side of the map and took our towers one by one around minutes we d lost all outer towers we didn t leave the base for the next minutes we so hard that our silencer got an abandon even though he was completely playing it wasn t fun it was boring as shit but every time they pushed high ground we repelled them and then they made the mistake of getting caught in rosh without buybacks by a smoke gank and we pushed down mid and won the game it was stupid we shouldn t have won at all they re equally stupid for not building bkbs now that i actually look at it though but still 	-0.2359	0.4797	149	1

I began working in the tobacco fields of middle Tennessee at eight years old in the early 1970s. I made .25 cents hourly, and by the time I left the fields for more traditional employment at 16 years old, I was making $2 per hour. My family didn't own any of the tobacco fields; instead, I worked in a neighbor's fields, or any of the other area growers needing help. I did everything from laying out the seed beds in preparation of the spring planting, to stripping and bundling the leaves for its eventual sale. I once fell off the top rung in a three story barn while hanging the tobacco leaves, freshly cut from the field, and in advance of the firing process that gives the tobacco its brown, cured appearance. Because I was small, I fit well in the small spaces at the barn's roof, but the inside temperature was well in excess of 100 degrees. I passed out and woke up in a bed of tobacco leaves in the tail-bed of a truck. I was told I fell right into the back of the truck, which probably saved my life because the leaves cushioned my fall. The guy I was working for was irritated because it slowed work down. He watched as I drank two big cups of water, and then sent me right back up to the top tier. It's extremely hard work, but the only paying job in the area, at the time. Tennessee labor laws didn't allow a child to begin work until age 16, and even if it allowed for an earlier age, the area was so rural that only tiny country stores offered employment. Additionally, most of those jobs went to the store owners' kids.	i began working in the tobacco fields of middle tennessee at eight years old in the early s i made cents hourly and by the time i left the fields for more traditional employment at years old i was making per hour my family didn t own any of the tobacco fields instead i worked in a neighbor s fields or any of the other area growers needing help i did everything from laying out the seed beds in preparation of the spring planting to stripping and bundling the leaves for its eventual sale i once fell off the top rung in a three story barn while hanging the tobacco leaves freshly cut from the field and in advance of the firing process that gives the tobacco its brown cured appearance because i was small i fit well in the small spaces at the barn s roof but the inside temperature was well in excess of degrees i passed out and woke up in a bed of tobacco leaves in the tail bed of a truck i was told i fell right into the back of the truck which probably saved my life because the leaves my fall the guy i was working for was irritated because it slowed work down he watched as i drank two big cups of water and then sent me right back up to the top tier it s extremely hard work but the only paying job in the area at the time tennessee labor laws didn t allow a child to begin work until age and even if it allowed for an earlier age the area was so rural that only tiny country stores offered employment additionally most of those jobs went to the store owners kids 	0.1107	0.4304	293	0

THIS. After losing a baby, a lot of 'well meaning' people would say unhelpful things to me such as 'ah, you'll just have to get trying for the next one' 'it's for the best' ' these things happen for a reason' 'it wasn't a baby yet anyway (seriously WTF!)' I hated these comments as my baby was already a huge part of my life and on my mind every second of every day. If you know people who may say these sorts of things, get between them and your wife and try to fend off these comments. In my very emotional state I nearly punched a friend of a friend in the face for her advice. Losing your child is an awful experience. Be there, listen and be open with her too. You may find she is unable to process your grief over hers which can lead to resentment between the two of you. Make sure you both have other people to open up to - yes, you as well. Take time to mourn and make a little box of mementos. You may not want to look at it for years, but one day you will want those memories and it would be awful not to have them. We have a small fairy/angel statue in our living room in memory of our baby. It's small and discrete but it's always there with me.

"Potential kidnapping attempt in parking lot. Last year I worked in retail, and I was out in the parking lot getting the carts. We had been closed for about 15 minutes. It wasn't unusual for cars to stop by close to me and ask if we were closed around this time, so when a red car did so I didn't think it was strange. He rolled down the window and asked, ""Are you guys closed now?"" I answered, ""Yep, 15 minutes now."" Usually the cars drive off at this point, but this guy (I honestly can't remember what he looked like, since I didn't think it was weird at the time so he didn't stick out) asked, ""Could you come here for a second then?"" I have the carts lined up now and I don't have time to deal with a customer who I've just informed the store is closed. I just want to get my tasks done, help my co-workers with their tasks, and see if we could get out out of there in a hurry. I tell the man, ""No, sorry. I have to get these carts up to the store so we can lock the doors."" He insists, ""I just have a question, it won't take a moment to answer. Can you just come help me?"" I'm a little unnerved by this, but I just say, ""Sorry, I can't,"" and begin to push the carts to the store. Thankfully he just drove away. The scary thing is that when I got up to the store, the front doors were locked. They weren't supposed to be locked until everyone was done working outside for safety issues just like this, but sometimes they got locked early for some reason. I pressed the buzzer that let the manager in the office know I was outside, and she let me in. But if that guy had gotten it into his mind to stay in the parking lot and saw that the front doors were locked and I was stuck outside, what then? Would he have tried to abduct me? I was still unnerved, but not really shaken or disturbed. The full impact of what could have happened hit me when I got home. I always told my boyfriend about any weird or annoying customers I encountered during my shift, and when I told him about this, he asked, ""Did you tell the manager?"" I said no, and he scolded me. ""The guy was an obvious creeper, and you didn't think to tell anyone?"" He even wanted to alert the police, but I didn't see the point because the only thing I could remember about the car was that it was red. I couldn't even tell you what type it was. The man's features weren't really distinguished at all either. Maybe nothing would have happened and the guy didn't realize how creepy be was being, but in any case, I'd rather not meet again."	potential kidnapping attempt in parking lot last year i worked in retail and i was out in the parking lot getting the carts we had been closed for about minutes it wasn t unusual for cars to stop by close to me and ask if we were closed around this time so when a red car did so i didn t think it was strange he rolled down the window and asked are you guys closed now ? i answered yep minutes now usually the cars drive off at this point but this guy i honestly can t remember what he looked like since i didn t think it was weird at the time so he didn t stick out asked could you come here for a second then ? i have the carts lined up now and i don t have time to deal with a customer who i ve just informed the store is closed i just want to get my tasks done help my co workers with their tasks and see if we could get out out of there in a hurry i tell the man no sorry i have to get these carts up to the store so we can lock the doors he insists i just have a question it won t take a moment to answer can you just come help me ? i m a little unnerved by this but i just say sorry i can t and begin to push the carts to the store thankfully he just drove away the scary thing is that when i got up to the store the front doors were locked they weren t supposed to be locked until everyone was done working outside for safety issues just like this but sometimes they got locked early for some reason i pressed the buzzer that let the manager in the office know i was outside and she let me in but if that guy had gotten it into his mind to stay in the parking lot and saw that the front doors were locked and i was stuck outside what then ? would he have tried to abduct me ? i was still unnerved but not really shaken or disturbed the full impact of what could have happened hit me when i got home i always told my boyfriend about any weird or annoying customers i encountered during my shift and when i told him about this he asked did you tell the manager ? i said no and he scolded me the guy was an obvious creeper and you didn t think to tell anyone ? he even wanted to alert the police but i didn t see the point because the only thing i could remember about the car was that it was red i couldn t even tell you what type it was the man s features weren t really distinguished at all either maybe nothing would have happened and the guy didn t realize how creepy be was being but in any case i d rather not meet again 	-0.0885	0.3363	516	1

They have, but there's been no consistent evidence worthy of scientific investigation. Unfortunately ghosts fall into the realm of religion when it comes to science, so they won't even entertain investigating it. The other issue is that every study done on the ouija board was in a laboratory setting. Of course it isn't going to work. I'd love to see them lug their lab equipment to a haunted location and measure all the readings there the way ghost hunters do. It probably is our subconscious controlling the ouija board through the ideomotor effect, but that's not to say the spirits aren't using us as a medium to move it.	they have but there s been no consistent evidence worthy of scientific investigation unfortunately ghosts fall into the realm of religion when it comes to science so they won t even entertain investigating it the other issue is that every study done on the ouija board was in a laboratory setting of course it isn t going to work i d love to see them lug their lab equipment to a haunted location and measure all the readings there the way ghost hunters do it probably is our subconscious controlling the ouija board through the ideomotor effect but that s not to say the spirits aren t using us as a medium to move it 	0.0139	0.5223	115	0

Here is my problem with free trade and conservatives: Theory - free trade will help poorer countries grow which will open new markets for the US and spur job growth. Reality - ok, makes sense....but you forgot something. What happens is businesses close here and people lose jobs as the first step. Then they lose their house, car, etc. And maybe, just maybe in 5-10 years more jobs will open up. All the while conservatives are yelling at people needing food stamps, unemployment, etc and calling them lazy. And, of course, they are busy union busting so when some jobs do come back you won't be making as much as you were before.	here is my problem with free trade and conservatives theory free trade will help poorer countries grow which will open new markets for the us and spur job growth reality ok makes sense but you forgot something what happens is businesses close here and people lose jobs as the first step then they lose their house car etc and maybe just maybe in years more jobs will open up all the while conservatives are yelling at people needing food stamps unemployment etc and calling them lazy and of course they are busy union busting so when some jobs do come back you won t be making as much as you were before 	0.1864	0.4853	112	0

So you're telling me earlier it's okay to have opinions, now you're all on my throat because I'm not giving you scientific results of extensive researches. It's an opinion. Mostly based on feelings and morals. The problem is that you do not see it as wrong (which is a feeling, so opinion). Some things are just wrong because the majority thinks so. Rape is wrong because we think so, but some cultures still does not see the difference between rape and sex. Now this idea of sexualizing things as wrong is new, so it'll take time before it catches up but I sure as hell hope it does. No, I am not being inconsistent. In your head as in no one knows about it =/= in your head as in mental difference/difficulty. All I'm saying is this. I have an opinion. I obviously like my opinion. Yours is the opposite, and I find it sickening. Which is bad because it's your opinion. Opinion, by the way, meaning based on feelings, experiences, among other things. We're trying to convince each other, because you want freedom of doing whatever, I want people to stop sexualizing everything there is because my opinion is that it's harmful. It just is. Based on nothing. Like most opinions.	so you re telling me earlier it s okay to have opinions now you re all on my throat because i m not giving you scientific results of extensive researches it s an opinion mostly based on feelings and morals the problem is that you do not see it as wrong which is a feeling so opinion some things are just wrong because the majority thinks so rape is wrong because we think so but some cultures still does not see the difference between rape and sex now this idea of sexualizing things as wrong is new so it ll take time before it catches up but i sure as hell hope it does no i am not being inconsistent in your head as in no one knows about it annoyed in your head as in mental difference difficulty all i m saying is this i have an opinion i obviously like my opinion yours is the opposite and i find it sickening which is bad because it s your opinion opinion by the way meaning based on feelings experiences among other things we re trying to convince each other because you want freedom of doing whatever i want people to stop sexualizing everything there is because my opinion is that it s harmful it just is based on nothing like most opinions 	-0.1349	0.59	223	1

I get the train and the bus, and I don't like public transport because: * It's expensive * It's slow * If the buses fills up they don't stop to let passengers on. So you can't rely on it to get you somewhere on time. The next bus might not be for another 20 minutes. * Has sick people spreading their illnesses * It's uncomfortable and crowded - sometimes I can't get a seat and have to stand up, and sometimes I get squished by someone, I also do my groceries and have to carry them on my lap because someone decided to sit next to me with all my groceries instead of one of the other free chairs. * It's dirty - people always leave their rubbish on the train, especially the later ones after peak hour. * Bad experiences - a guy once jerked off next to me on the train. I still catch public transport only because * It's still slightly cheaper than driving * The train can be faster than driving in peak hour I sometimes stay near work and just walk to work, but it is 4km over fairly hilly terrain and can be a little tiring after a long work day, and not that safe.	i get the train and the bus and i don t like public transport because it s expensive it s slow if the buses fills up they don t stop to let passengers on so you can t rely on it to get you somewhere on time the next bus might not be for another minutes has sick people spreading their illnesses it s uncomfortable and crowded sometimes i can t get a seat and have to stand up and sometimes i get squished by someone i also do my groceries and have to carry them on my lap because someone decided to sit next to me with all my groceries instead of one of the other free chairs it s dirty people always leave their rubbish on the train especially the later ones after peak hour bad experiences a guy once jerked off next to me on the train i still catch public transport only because it s still slightly cheaper than driving the train can be faster than driving in peak hour i sometimes stay near work and just walk to work but it is km over fairly hilly terrain and can be a little tiring after a long work day and not that safe 	-0.0974	0.427	207	1

We have a shelf of unreleased books that we can take home. I've read a few of them, honestly they haven't been my favorites. A few days ago someone left their payed copy of Flowers for Algernon at the check out counter and I read it during my shift and it was depressing at shit. So far, my best day at work was my first time working at the Customer Services desk because there was no one there who needed help so I pretty much spent the day hanging out with my friend at the children's section. My managers are super chill so they don't care if we just stand around and talk as long as there are no customers looking for help. So yeah, it would either be that day or this other time when it was storming and we were doing inventory so for the last two hours of my shift there were literally no customers so we went around the store taking pictures with the hand puppets.	we have a shelf of unreleased books that we can take home i ve read a few of them honestly they haven t been my favorites a few days ago someone left their payed copy of flowers for algernon at the check out counter and i read it during my shift and it was depressing at shit so far my best day at work was my first time working at the customer services desk because there was no one there who needed help so i pretty much spent the day hanging out with my friend at the children s section my managers are super chill so they don t care if we just stand around and talk as long as there are no customers looking for help so yeah it would either be that day or this other time when it was storming and we were doing inventory so for the last two hours of my shift there were literally no customers so we went around the store taking pictures with the hand puppets 	0.0706	0.7265	174	0
So if a person doing low-carb had an increase in cortisol from a stressful event, they could potentially be knocked out of ketosis from the rise in blood sugar from gluconeogenises, which may result in some weight gain from fluid retention that usually happens when, for example, someone doing keto has a cheat day (holy run-on sentence). But nothing like the 50+ lbs that this guy has gained.	so if a person doing low carb had an increase in cortisol from a stressful event they could potentially be knocked out of ketosis from the rise in blood sugar from which may result in some weight gain from fluid retention that usually happens when for example someone doing keto has a cheat day holy run on sentence but nothing like the lbs that this guy has gained 	-0.0833	0.1875	68	1

All I can say is, don't cheat. If you are on the verge of cheating, recommend counseling. If she doesn't want to go to counseling, then tell her something needs to change or you will end the relationship. I'm saying this as a woman who was cheated on after being married for five years. It really fucked me up emotionally being cheated on. It's a difficult situation but cheating and getting caught is a horrible thing.

OP you have never experienced the bad sides of relationships, so you cannot understand where people are coming from when they fear commitment. People like being in control of their lives and when that is slowly chipped away by obligations (yes, a bf/gf can feel like an obligation sometimes) they tend to run away or fall into a rut. I love staying up late and working on various projects. If I had a girl there who wanted me to cuddle every night I would eventually go mental. I had to break up with a girl in college because she WOULD NOT LEAVE ME ALONE. I couldnt get homework done. I couldnt go out for a beer with just my male friends. She was so needy and a bit immature.

I want to give up, I really can't stand myself anymore. I was in Brazil for two months visiting family. I wish I hadnt. My boyfriend is a photographer and I saw on his page he took a few pictures of some girl. She is our friends ex girlfriend, who's a heroin addict and put her through the wringer. My boyfriend decided to introduce her to my group of friends, as she doesn't have monday because she's from a different part of the state. She's been around while I've been gone. I fought with my boyfriend when I saw those pictures, not knowing who she was. I found out, and I was over it. I come home, excited to be back (it wasn't the easiest trip...family is tough) and the next two days she comes over. She works with him, and another mutual friend and my head took me to the darkest places. Do they have something? Have I been replaced? In short, my mind won't stop, even though I KNOW none of this is true, and I feel like a psycho Fucking girlfriend and paranoid and sick and twisted and I want to relapse (2 years sober, alcoholic/addict) and I want to disappear. I hate admitting I have these insecurities, but I do. She's intimidated by me, and I talked to her, letting her know she's more than welcome here. To be honest, I wish she hadn't come into my life or anyone else's. I'm being selfish, I'm being horrible and I hate myself for being this person. I wish I had never existed. I hate myself and this is all so Stupid and it sounds so Stupid but it already hurts enough to write down my fears. It's been downplayed. I don't think he would do anything to me. I know he didn't, but there is a voice in my head telling me that I'm alone, and everyone is hiding something from me. I'm in AA, I have resources, but I'd just rather hang myself in my closet and Dissapear. EDIT: not monday, I meant she doesn't have many friends.	i want to give up i really can t stand myself anymore i was in brazil for two months visiting family i wish i hadnt my boyfriend is a photographer and i saw on his page he took a few pictures of some girl she is our friends ex girlfriend who s a heroin addict and put her through the my boyfriend decided to introduce her to my group of friends as she doesn t have monday because she s from a different part of the state she s been around while i ve been gone i fought with my boyfriend when i saw those pictures not knowing who she was i found out and i was over it i come home excited to be back it wasn t the easiest trip family is tough and the next two days she comes over she works with him and another mutual friend and my head took me to the darkest places do they have something ? have i been replaced ? in short my mind won t stop even though i know none of this is true and i feel like a psycho fucking girlfriend and paranoid and sick and twisted and i want to relapse years sober alcoholic addict and i want to disappear i hate admitting i have these insecurities but i do she s intimidated by me and i talked to her letting her know she s more than welcome here to be honest i wish she hadn t come into my life or anyone else s i m being selfish i m being horrible and i hate myself for being this person i wish i had never existed i hate myself and this is all so stupid and it sounds so stupid but it already hurts enough to write down my fears it s been downplayed i don t think he would do anything to me i know he didn t but there is a voice in my head telling me that i m alone and everyone is hiding something from me i m in aa i have resources but i d just rather hang myself in my closet and dissapear edit not monday i meant she doesn t have many friends 	-0.1782	0.4637	375	1

Hey... I know it seems bad but keep pressing on. We've all been there. Especially with the suicidal thoughts. But why should you stop living just because of someone else?

"If I'm understanding the research correctly at all, it's not inherent to the bacteria alone. It happened when the researchers added feedback from the robot to the bacteria into their theoretical model. When the robot starts to get close to a food source, it sends a chemical signal to the bacteria that boosts all the signals they are producing. I'm guessing this first drowns out the original food signal a bit, then enhances it if it's a true signal, making the robot ""rush"" forward. So although they haven't tested this in a real experiment, they predict from their model that this is a natural property that unexpectedly emerged from the two-way chemical communication between the machine and the bacteria."	if i m understanding the research correctly at all it s not inherent to the bacteria alone it happened when the researchers added feedback from the robot to the bacteria into their theoretical model when the robot starts to get close to a food source it sends a chemical signal to the bacteria that boosts all the signals they are producing i m guessing this first drowns out the original food signal a bit then enhances it if it s a true signal making the robot rush forward so although they haven t tested this in a real experiment they predict from their model that this is a natural property that unexpectedly emerged from the two way chemical communication between the machine and the bacteria 	0.1964	0.3824	125	0

Do any of you experience verbal thought confusion? I've noticed lately that I'm having trouble transferring thoughts and concepts into speech. Sometimes the words get confused and come out wrong, and other times it feels like I haven't fully put together an idea before I begin speaking. It often ends up sounding like I'm beating around an idea without actually saying anything. It's like I have it all sorted out in my head (generally), but when I actually go to tell other people about it it just comes out vague and sometimes nonsensical. It's made conversations more awkward, because sometimes I take a moment to recollect my thoughts, and other people think that that's an opportunity to cut in. This is incredibly frustrating, and I'm having a lot of anxiety about it. Have any of you experienced this?

weren't enough Anglo-Saxons to completely dominate the native gene pool This article goes into more detail: * ['Myths of British ancestry' by Stephen Oppenheimer in *Prospect* magazine](http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/features/mythsofbritishancestry) But **the English still derive most of their current gene pool from the same early Basque source as the Irish, Welsh and Scots**. These figures are at odds with the modern perceptions of Celtic and Anglo-Saxon ethnicity based on more recent invasions.

I agree with you but it's not taking a dig at everyone in that situation. Given my lack of giveashit about relationships these days, I may actually end up that way too. But this particular guy, according to my friend, is NOT content living his life alone and is NOT happy about not having children yet. That's why I made that comment. It was just funny to me that he was lamenting recently about being bad with women and then he makes those weird comments to me.	i agree with you but it s not taking a dig at everyone in that situation given my lack of about relationships these days i may actually end up that way too but this particular guy according to my friend is not content living his life alone and is not happy about not having children yet that s why i made that comment it was just funny to me that he was lamenting recently about being bad with women and then he makes those weird comments to me 	-0.169	0.5593	88	1

Around 12 when I was going into puberty my joint pain got worse. Then again around 16 or something. When I was 18 I began going grey. Now I am 23 and probably a quarter of the way grey.

Depends. I mean, I don't eat meat so if someone asks for a recommendation like that, I usually state what others have told me and the reputation. I used to work at a juice bar, and when it wasn't ferociously busy, 90% of the time I had an in depth conversation, explaining everything, giving them recommendations. That was my favorite part of my job! At the end of the day, though, we all have different tastes. I could like one restaurants type of sauce, and you may hate it, but we both like spaghetti sauce. So, it's hard. But to answer your question directly, no, it's not annoying to me AT ALL. I love it. I think a lot of bartenders are like this too!

"No that was just one example. And it's not because she kept asking me stuff, and it wasn't annoying at all. I just mean that when I'm around people, they're not at their happiest. Ever. But when I'm not, like when I would walk way behind them, it's like they felt way better. My presence feels inappropriate. And what's funny is that even the baby notices it. He's a really happy baby, not shy at all, and he laughs all the time. But then when he looks at me (I'm no stranger), he just stops laughing or smiling. He looks at me like I just ruined it for him. Then he looks at someone else and immediately starts laughing and smiling again. I just have a bad aura.

It honestly makes me angry how conservative she is expected to dress. 3) I definitely can see the double standard when it comes to purity. Sadly, I think this double standard comes from the world view that any sort of impurity will taint a woman (which I extremely disagree with). 4) My parents are dictators in my household; you either do what they say or you can face some heavy consequences.

That's a football study regarding a certain design. That design may eventually make it into snow sports but I'm talking about the recent evidence on ski helmets that are in use today. Here's one: The helmet does a very good job at protecting against skull lacerations and skull fractures, but it doesnt seem to have much effect on concussions or T.B.I.s, Shealy said, referring to traumatic brain injuries. Jasper Shealy, a professor emeritus at Rochester Institute of Technology, has been studying snow-sports-related injuries at Sugarbush resort in Vermont for more than 30 years.

Feelings aren't always reasonable, and no one *owes* you their friendship. This is true, which is why I said that it wasn't unreasonable for OP's friend to be upset for a little while. If I were in that situation, I would initially be upset too. I might be mad that my crush was with someone else, or jealous that my friend was with someone I liked when I wanted to be the one taking him home from the club. But ultimately I would be most mad at myself, for never even trying to talk to him about it. Which is why I think that OP's friend will hopefully get past this. She shouldn't be mad at her friend for fucking a guy. She should be mad for not putting herself out there and making an effort to get what she wants. If you never chase your dreams, the only person you can truly blame for not achieving them is yourself.	feelings aren t always reasonable and no one you their friendship this is true which is why i said that it wasn t unreasonable for op s friend to be upset for a little while if i were in that situation i would initially be upset too i might be mad that my crush was with someone else or jealous that my friend was with someone i liked when i wanted to be the one taking him home from the club but ultimately i would be most mad at myself for never even trying to talk to him about it which is why i think that op s friend will hopefully get past this she shouldn t be mad at her friend for fucking a guy she should be mad for not putting herself out there and making an effort to get what she wants if you never chase your dreams the only person you can truly blame for not achieving them is yourself 	-0.1125	0.5207	164	1

"Had a very bad break down in school today. Not even sure I can make it through the night. Long and heart wrenching story short, my bestfriend, who was my boyfriend for a very long time up until he tried to kill himself a month ago and came back saying he wanted a break because he might be gay. Well, today, walking to lunch, I saw him holding this girl M's hand... I don't know what came over me, but I screamed ""I can't! No!"" and ran into the bathroom, where coincidentally my best friend Chloe had been. I started screaming and crying and, apparently, I said ""I just want to die"" a few times. M, who has actually been making mine and his life a living hell for months, came in and started yelling at me, saying ""What the fuck is wrong? Is it because w were holding hands? He's gay, get over it!"" and I just died inside at that point, because, if he really is gay, I'm losing everything I had at one point, indefinitely. I guess I kept asking her to stop but she wouldn't so Chloe made her leave, and while Chloe was gone, I threw up all over myself while I cried. A counselor came in and took me to the office where my favorite teacher (guy. funny. suffers from anxiety and depression) let me just vent, since he knows everything I have gone through with bestfriend/boyfriend person. I had to write an incident report because of what Madison did and shit. I got calmed down and when I finally started walking back to class, I saw M with bestfriend/boyfriend's beanie... I died a little and went to class with tears in my eyes, as always. After that class ended, I went to bestfriend/boyfriend- let's start calling him J- and said ""I don't think you mean to, but you're breaking my heart."" and he just looked at me and said he was sorry, and explained him and M have *nothing* going on at all, and he just held her hand for a moment to calm her down. I explained how awful it is, since I used to mean everything to him and now I feel like I mean nothing at all to him. He said, and I quote ""I never meant to push anyone out, especially not *you*. You still mean a lot to me. Like, a lot, I just..."" I then said ""Do we have a chance anymore, J?"" to which he responded to by shrugging and saying ""I don't know."" and then he gave me a hug and I whispered ""I'm sorry"" into his neck and he just gave me the saddest look I've ever seen and went into art textiles... I know he really doesn't know. He's not saying it because he doesn't have the guts to say no. He's just extremely fucking confused with everything at the moment. This is the first time since he got back that I've actually expressed that this is effecting me negatively, and I didn't even *really* express it to him. Two of our friends are going to talk to him about this tomorrow, because they are both quite pissed about the way he's handling this, especially after today... I miss what I had, and I don't know why I feel so broken. I really just want to die, to be honest. It would feel a lot better than this... I'm cutting again, I've stopped taking my meds... I just... I've been suffering in silence for a month. Today, I broke that silence, but in the wrong way, and to the wrong person... Sorry for that wall of text."	had a very bad break down in school today not even sure i can make it through the night long and heart wrenching story short my bestfriend who was my boyfriend for a very long time up until he tried to kill himself a month ago and came back saying he wanted a break because he might be gay well today walking to lunch i saw him holding this girl m s hand i don t know what came over me but i screamed i can t ! no ! and ran into the bathroom where coincidentally my best friend chloe had been i started screaming and crying and apparently i said i just want to die a few times m who has actually been making mine and his life a living hell for months came in and started yelling at me saying what the fuck is wrong ? is it because w were holding hands ? he s gay get over it ! and i just died inside at that point because if he really is gay i m losing everything i had at one point indefinitely i guess i kept asking her to stop but she wouldn t so chloe made her leave and while chloe was gone i threw up all over myself while i cried a counselor came in and took me to the office where my favorite teacher guy funny suffers from anxiety and depression let me just vent since he knows everything i have gone through with bestfriend boyfriend person i had to write an incident report because of what madison did and shit i got calmed down and when i finally started walking back to class i saw m with bestfriend boyfriend s beanie i died a little and went to class with tears in my eyes as always after that class ended i went to bestfriend boyfriend let s start calling him j and said i don t think you mean to but you re breaking my heart and he just looked at me and said he was sorry and explained him and m have *nothing* going on at all and he just held her hand for a moment to calm her down i explained how awful it is since i used to mean everything to him and now i feel like i mean nothing at all to him he said and i quote i never meant to push anyone out especially not *you* you still mean a lot to me like a lot i just i then said do we have a chance anymore j ? to which he responded to by shrugging and saying i don t know and then he gave me a hug and i whispered i m sorry into his neck and he just gave me the saddest look i ve ever seen and went into art textiles i know he really doesn t know he s not saying it because he doesn t have the guts to say no he s just extremely fucking confused with everything at the moment this is the first time since he got back that i ve actually expressed that this is effecting me negatively and i didn t even *really* express it to him two of our friends are going to talk to him about this tomorrow because they are both quite pissed about the way he s handling this especially after today i miss what i had and i don t know why i feel so broken i really just want to die to be honest it would feel a lot better than this i m cutting again i ve stopped taking my meds i just i ve been suffering in silence for a month today i broke that silence but in the wrong way and to the wrong person sorry for that wall of text 	-0.0802	0.5325	647	1

How surprising were traditional plot twists in TVs and movies when they first aired? Alright, first things first, I'm not sure if this is appropriate for this subreddit, so if not let me know and I'll delete the post. If anyone knows of a better place, please share. So onto the question... I've been watching a lot of older sci-fi and it all seems very twist heavy, and it got me thinking, how surprising where the twists when they first appeared in cinema? On one side of the coin - even if you hadn't seen or heard of the twists before, you can still 'see them coming', they all seem kind of obvious. However, today's audiences are probably more trained to that sort of thinking, right? Would older twists have been more likely to take people by surprise, even if they'd seem obvious to movie goers today? Twists still predated movies and television too, so it's not like it was a new concept. Some specific examples I'm interested in - were most people surprised by the twists in: * Planet of the Apes * In general, The Twilight Zone * Hitchcock's Psycho * Soylent Green * Invasion of the Body Snatchers (haven't seen original, but I'm referencing the end of the 1978 version where it leads you to believe he is human trying to fit in, but is actually 'snatched') * That one dude being a robot in Alien (forgot his name)	how surprising were traditional plot twists in tvs and movies when they first aired ? alright first things first i m not sure if this is appropriate for this subreddit so if not let me know and i ll delete the post if anyone knows of a better place please share so onto the question i ve been watching a lot of older sci fi and it all seems very twist heavy and it got me thinking how surprising where the twists when they first appeared in cinema ? on one side of the coin even if you hadn t seen or heard of the twists before you can still see them coming they all seem kind of obvious however today s audiences are probably more trained to that sort of thinking right ? would older twists have been more likely to take people by surprise even if they d seem obvious to movie goers today ? twists still predated movies and television too so it s not like it was a new concept some specific examples i m interested in were most people surprised by the twists in planet of the apes in general the twilight zone hitchcock s psycho soylent green invasion of the body snatchers haven t seen original but i m referencing the end of the version where it leads you to believe he is human trying to fit in but is actually snatched that one dude being a robot in alien forgot his name 	0.2009	0.2047	249	0

"I know ours (USCG) harkens back to the days of the Revenue Cutter Service. I pulled this from [uscg.mil](http://www.uscg.mil): The Revenue Marine and the Revenue Cutter Service , as it was known variously throughout the late 18th and the 19th centuries, referred to its ships as cutters. The term is English in origin and refers to a specific type of vessel, namely, ""a small, decked ship with one mast and bowsprit, with a gaff mainsail on a boom, a square yard and topsail, and two jibs or a jib and a staysail."" (Peter Kemp, editor, The Oxford Companion to Ships the Sea; London: Oxford University Press, 1976; pp. 221-222.) The Royal Navy's definition of a cutter was a small warship capable of carrying 8 to 12 cannons.*** By general usage, the term cutter came to define any vessel of Great Britain's Royal Customs Service and the term was adopted by the U.S. Treasury Department at the creation of what would become the Revenue Marine. Since that time, no matter what the vessel type, the service has referred to its largest vessels as cutters (today a cutter is any Coast Guard vessel over 65-feet in length). And the little addition as denoted by ""***"": ***BMC Joseph Noecker, USCG (Ret.) in an email to the Historian's Office, noted: "". . .cutters in the British man-of-war designations had 8 to 12 guns/cannon. . .

Tbh it sounds like there's a problem with her, not you, that she doesn't want to tell you. Especially if she contacted you later to make you not feel bad - if you'd pissed her off she wouldn't give a fuck. Has she broken up with anyone recently, and can't relate to a new guy yet? A self esteem issue where she feels like she doesn't deserve you? (Unlikely I know, but I've seen a girl with depression remain convinced that no one could ever love her even after being asked out by a guy)	tbh it sounds like there s a problem with her not you that she doesn t want to tell you especially if she contacted you later to make you not feel bad if you d pissed her off she wouldn t give a fuck has she broken up with anyone recently and can t relate to a new guy yet ? a self esteem issue where she feels like she doesn t deserve you ? unlikely i know but i ve seen a girl with depression remain convinced that no one could ever love her even after being asked out by a guy 	-0.1515	0.5102	103	1

"I just used a scooter at the grocery store for the first time. And I hated it. I'm 22, at a reasonable weight, and dont look sick. Today I'm having a high pain day. Usually I don't need a scooter or I just sit in the cart and make my boyfriend push me because I would rather look like I'm dicking around then like I have health problems. Anyway, the variety of looks I got made me incredibly uncomfortable. Being a white punk in a dominantly black southern area that happens a lot anyway. Haha. But a lot of the looks were either the sympathetic 'bless yer heart' looks or they would look at me like I'm a jerk for using a scooter that someone unwell might need. When I was returning the scooter a guy came up to me and with a dirty look said ""Can I have that?"". Yeah dude, I'm half way off. Luckily I'm not as irritable as some days. I just wanted to vent to some people who understand having an invisible disease. I know this is not a major issue, but its the little things we have to deal with.

You didn't specify what type of order you're making. You can't really make an order like you described. The closest thing would be a limit order, in which case as soon as the order is submitted, it is executed at the current bid price (essentially converted to a market order), since the current price is above your limit price. There's no scenario I know of in which what you proposed would have any impact on the stock's price, from a pure price point of view. That said, if you have a large amount of stock that you unload, that volume alone might will usually have an impact on the stock's price. That's why it's important to watch institutional investors, since they generally invest much larger sums of money into equities. So, for example, when they start buying $FB because it recently got added to the S P, you can expect to see a positive impact on the price.	you didn t specify what type of order you re making you can t really make an order like you described the closest thing would be a limit order in which case as soon as the order is submitted it is executed at the current bid price essentially converted to a market order since the current price is above your limit price there s no scenario i know of in which what you proposed would have any impact on the stock s price from a pure price point of view that said if you have a large amount of stock that you unload that volume alone might will usually have an impact on the stock s price that s why it s important to watch institutional investors since they generally invest much larger sums of money into equities so for example when they start buying because it recently got added to the s p you can expect to see a positive impact on the price 	0.0812	0.414	165	0

Any M-Audio Venom owners out there? I understand this wasn't a very popular virtual/sampler synthesizer. I can understand some of the gripes I've come across on forums. Support being discontinued being the biggest. But, I am impressed by some of the sounds this thing can produce. I like that it can be programmed and then disconnected from the computer. I was wondering if anyone had any advice with programming the thing. I've spent a few hours with it, and I'm amazed by the number of parameters and controls the thing has. The multi function seems really powerful. Does anyone have any experience with uploading patterns? I've noodled around with many of the presets, but still haven't found a clear path toward making my own patches from scratch. Is that possible? Any other general advice would be greatly appreciated.

"I think my (20 F) father (60 M) just threw me and my wife (20 F) out. I'm pretty upset for good reason and sitting in a McDonald's typing this, so sorry if it's all jumbled and fucked up. We recently moved back in with my parents because my job doesn't like to pay me correctly and we couldn't keep up with our rent. My 18 year old brother is prince of the mother fucking earth. He does whatever the fuck he wants, including, tonight, when he came in the bathroom while I was showering and turned on the sink water and started flipping out and calling me names because I let his stupid ass dog in his room so it wouldn't shit on my goddamn flood. Big surprise, the fucking puppy shit on the floor. He should have taken the fucking dog out or put it in it's crate if he wasn't going to be able to take it out. I told him to turn the water off because the family dog had just puked all over me and I was trying to get cleaned off. He wouldn't. I told him to get the fuck out of the bathroom. He said ""Or what, you'll sit on me?"" I ran to my room and got dressed. I went downstairs and told my parents that SOMETHING needs to be done about their goddamn hellion. My dad said ""I hate to say it, but I think it's time you find a place to live."" My wife and I left and came to this McDonald's. I don't know what the fuck to do from here.

I have tried many times but I lose interest immediately.

It was too long, so I broke it into 3: What repulsive thing can be found in a niggers clothes? The nigger. A Liverpool docker went to South Africa for a job. The boss tells him: Its people like you we want here. Heres a test. Theres a revolver, go out and shoot 6 niggers and a rabbit. The docker asks: Why do I have to shoot the rabbit? He got the job. Racism is when you run over a nigger with your truck. Reverse-racism is when you back up. Why dont niggers celebrate Thanksgiving? Kentucky Fried Chicken isnt open on holidays. If Tarzan and Jane were black, what would Cheetah be? The brains of the outfit. Why are so many niggers moving to Detroit? They heard there were no jobs there. What does cotton have in common with noses? Niggers are good at picking both. Why do niggers always have sex on their minds? Because of the pubic hair on their heads.

"So discouraged (F/5'5/225) I'm a dieting guru. I've tried it all, failed at it all, and now I'm extremely discouraged. I just finished day 5 of whole30, where basically for 30 days you don't put anything artificial in your body. It's paleo, but doesn't allow for paleo hacks either (like paleo desserts), and no artificial sweeteners, limited fruit intake, no dairy or legumes, etc.... I'm so pissed off today. I hate greens, I hate vegetables, I don't think this is ever going to work for me. I've had food issues since I was young. When I was 3 my parents found me eating Oreos in the pantry after they were fighting. I have half a thyroid, PCOS, and had my gallbladder out in January. Since the surgery I have gained 30 lbs. Those of you who know anything about hypothyroidism and PCOS, losing weight is extremely difficult. I have tried every diet you can think of that doesn't involve food delivery. Weight watchers, keto, Atkins, low fat high carb, and now paleo. I'm sick of being disgusted with my body, but I'm also sick of the dieting mentality I'm stuck with. I even tried giving up the diet mentality in April but ended up gaining 10 lbs because I didn't deny myself anything. I'm at my wits end. The only time I have ever had success in weight loss was when I wasn't even trying. I would eat a #1 from McDonald's every morning, walk a mile on campus to get to my classes, then eat a McDonald's cheeseburger (the tiny ones) for dinner. I never denied myself anything, but I was on Zoloft, which killed my appetite. I would go out to eat and have two bites and be ""full"" (nauseated). I dropped 50 lbs in 8 months doing this. Only downside is that while the Zoloft killed my appetite, it killed my personality and sex drive, too. I'm currently in counseling and have discussed my issues with food, but simply depriving myself of things leads to me bingeing later, even if I try to acknowledge and think through the feelings I'm having. I've tried CBT, I'm on anti-depressants still (Celexa), along with medicine for PCOS and hypothyroidism. I don't know why I'm putting this here. I don't know what I need from you, /r/loseit. I just know that I had to tell someone my feelings. Maybe I've convinced myself I'm never going to lose the weight, never going to get pregnant, and live a miserable life because of it. When I was at 170lbs in 2010, I was the most content I've ever been in my life despite having zero personality. I loved my body and had confidence. TL;DR: I've tried everything and am close to giving up. I don't know what to do. Edit: Thanks for all the encouragement and advice. If you want to add me on MFP my username is lefoll. I have taken what everyone has said to heart and am not going to give up. I may not stay on the whole30 wagon for much longer, but I'll be making wiser choices and I'm going for a walk (at least) tonight."	so discouraged f i m a dieting guru i ve tried it all failed at it all and now i m extremely discouraged i just finished day of where basically for days you don t put anything artificial in your body it s paleo but doesn t allow for paleo hacks either like paleo desserts and no artificial sweeteners limited fruit intake no dairy or legumes etc i m so pissed off today i hate greens i hate vegetables i don t think this is ever going to work for me i ve had food issues since i was young when i was my parents found me eating oreos in the pantry after they were fighting i have half a thyroid pcos and had my gallbladder out in january since the surgery i have gained lbs those of you who know anything about hypothyroidism and pcos losing weight is extremely difficult i have tried every diet you can think of that doesn t involve food delivery weight watchers keto atkins low fat high carb and now paleo i m sick of being disgusted with my body but i m also sick of the dieting mentality i m stuck with i even tried giving up the diet mentality in april but ended up gaining lbs because i didn t deny myself anything i m at my wits end the only time i have ever had success in weight loss was when i wasn t even trying i would eat a from mcdonald s every morning walk a mile on campus to get to my classes then eat a mcdonald s cheeseburger the tiny ones for dinner i never denied myself anything but i was on zoloft which killed my appetite i would go out to eat and have two bites and be full nauseated i dropped lbs in months doing this only downside is that while the zoloft killed my appetite it killed my personality and sex drive too i m currently in counseling and have discussed my issues with food but simply depriving myself of things leads to me bingeing later even if i try to acknowledge and think through the feelings i m having i ve tried cbt i m on anti depressants still celexa along with medicine for pcos and hypothyroidism i don t know why i m putting this here i don t know what i need from you r loseit i just know that i had to tell someone my feelings maybe i ve convinced myself i m never going to lose the weight never going to get pregnant and live a miserable life because of it when i was at lbs in i was the most content i ve ever been in my life despite having zero personality i loved my body and had confidence tl dr i ve tried everything and am close to giving up i don t know what to do edit thanks for all the encouragement and advice if you want to add me on mfp my username is i have taken what everyone has said to heart and am not going to give up i may not stay on the wagon for much longer but i ll be making wiser choices and i m going for a walk at least tonight 	-0.1432	0.4291	551	1

Husband is gaining weight. What's going wrong? He's 6'2 and around 360, but he's seen the scale go up 5 pounds in our first week of weighing (3rd week of keto). He says he's always hungry and is in ketosis all the time (I've seen the stix). I figured since he's a big guy he doesn't have to watch his calories *that* much, based on what I've read in this subreddit for the past 3 months or so. He also claims to be tired and hungry all the time. He drinks about a gallon of water every day, salad for lunch, meats and cheeses and veggies for dinner. Usually skips breakfast bc he doesn't have time as he likes to sleep as late as possible. He has a couple sprite zeroes a night. Meanwhile I've been losing on the diet faster than I've lost before. Any advice?	husband is gaining weight what s going wrong ? he s and around but he s seen the scale go up pounds in our first week of weighing rd week of keto he says he s always hungry and is in ketosis all the time i ve seen the i figured since he s a big guy he doesn t have to watch his calories *that* much based on what i ve read in this subreddit for the past months or so he also claims to be tired and hungry all the time he drinks about a gallon of water every day salad for lunch meats and cheeses and veggies for dinner usually skips breakfast bc he doesn t have time as he likes to sleep as late as possible he has a couple sprite zeroes a night meanwhile i ve been losing on the diet faster than i ve lost before any advice ? 	-0.125	0.3712	155	1
This sounds like a pretty good idea. And once fallout 4 is released and a large influx of new people start playing 3/NV then it could serve as some form of guide for beginners. I might as well contribute a tip myself. Whenever your going through the wasteland at early levels, always pick up any junk you see so long as it doesn't over encumber you. You can always sell it for some caps.

everyone hates having me around them As someone who used to think the same thing, I can assure you that they don't. I have atrocious self-esteem (it's getting better, and I'll tell you why), and frequently would go out with my friends and return home feeling like shit because of all the stupid things I've said or done. Focus in every tiny little thing that indicates that someone hated me, even though they'd been friends with me for years. I was utterly convinced that all these people despised me. This was because I deliberately sought out *excuses* to hate myself - evidence to support the warped view I had of myself. I would focus on every little thing I had done, and either blow it way out of proportion (like a joke that wasn't THAT funny, but could have been worse, becoming the most stupid fucking thing I've ever said) or come up with reasons why they actually hate me for it - which are completely unreasonable. I focused on every little bad thing I'd done and completely ignored everything good, or rationalised the good things to actually be a way to hate myself. So all I saw were bad things, all the time. You, I think, are doing the same. My friends, not being severely depressed, only saw the many good things - good jokes, kind gestures, insightful statements, general friend things - and none of the bad, because I hadn't actually done anything wrong. They thought I was cool. But I just couldn't see it, because I was so determined to prove them all wrong and took such pleasure in destroying myself. In summary, I can assure you that people love to be around you. You either don't notice the signs or are deliberately telling yourself they're wrong. If they didn't like you, they'd tell you to fuck off to your face.	everyone hates having me around them as someone who used to think the same thing i can assure you that they don t i have atrocious self esteem it s getting better and i ll tell you why and frequently would go out with my friends and return home feeling like shit because of all the stupid things i ve said or done focus in every tiny little thing that indicates that someone hated me even though they d been friends with me for years i was utterly convinced that all these people despised me this was because i deliberately sought out to hate myself evidence to support the warped view i had of myself i would focus on every little thing i had done and either blow it way out of proportion like a joke that wasn t that funny but could have been worse becoming the most stupid fucking thing i ve ever said or come up with reasons why they actually hate me for it which are completely unreasonable i focused on every little bad thing i d done and completely ignored everything good or the good things to actually be a way to hate myself so all i saw were bad things all the time you i think are doing the same my friends not being severely depressed only saw the many good things good jokes kind gestures insightful statements general friend things and none of the bad because i hadn t actually done anything wrong they thought i was cool but i just couldn t see it because i was so determined to prove them all wrong and took such pleasure in destroying myself in summary i can assure you that people love to be around you you either don t notice the signs or are deliberately telling yourself they re wrong if they didn t like you they d tell you to fuck off to your face 	-0.1058	0.5113	323	1

I learned something about my husband's childhood This was something that happened after we went to my husband's hometown a week ago. My husband, Kyle and I decided to go to his home when he was a child to gather some of his belongings there since no one is living on that house anymore after his parents passed away last year and a caretaker is currently maintaining it. We chatted about our lives before we met and he mentioned that he did something when he was a child and didn't remember anything about it. Maybe an instinct is telling him that he needs to forget about it that it might give a trauma to him when he remembers it. It feels like there's a gap of memories when he was a child. I didn't ask any questions after that and head to a stop over to have a little quick break. We arrived at his hometown around six in the evening and stop by at a mart to buy some dinner. We arrive at their house around 7:30. The caretaker was still awake and had waited for our arrival, we had dinner and had a goodnight rest and will start our task the following day. The next morning I saw my husband, standing at the window having a deep stare outside like a daydreaming thing. I said his name, Kyle? and said to me in a reply, Yes dear? Sorry I didnt wake you up. I was just remembering something. Its okay. Come on lets go get some breakfast and start packing your stuffs in your room. After having our breakfast, we chat with the caretaker and said that she did clean Kyles room but didnt remove or transfer any things so we wont have a hard time looking on some of his things. We then started bringing empty boxes on his room. His room is in the corner of the 2nd floor of the house and you would be able to pass all the other rooms before getting in his room. We started by bringing down some books and other things on the top of his cabinet and sorted those things if we needed to bring it or need to be disposed of. As I checked every book there, I saw this book with a weird cover with a broken lock. Didnt notice that it was a diary of him when he was 10 years old. Wait, 10 years old? It must be the time that he doesnt remember anything that happened to him. I suddenly feel the urge of reading it but of course, the owner is right in front of me. I wanted to read it together with him but it might worry that when he remembers his past experience it might cause a problem so I waited for Kyle to bring some of the things downstairs to free up some space. I then opened the diary and started reading some of his entries *** *July 19* I was playing with my younger sister Jessica while my mother is cooking food for our lunch. After a while, I heard papas footsteps approaching the kitchen with a mad look on his face. I then hear his shouting to mama. Then I heard mama shouting too. I said to Jessica to wait for me and went to the kitchen slowly. I hear their shout getting louder and louder. I saw their faces, they are angry. Are they angry at me? Mama then saw me standing scared at the door in the kitchen. She was panicking, went straight to me and happily said. Kyle, darling we we were just playing a game. It.. its only a joke I nod and went back to Jessica and continued to play. *August 1* I stayed after dismissal at school. I have to make a report for being late this morning. My classmate, Bruce went inside the classroom and started punching my face and throwing away my things. I can not fight back. I am too weak. He just punched me again at my face then my stomach. A teacher suddenly passed by and saw us. The teacher ask to us what happened I was about to say I am getting bullied when Bruce suddenly barged in, Um, we are just playing Mr. Charles. See? Mr. Charles did not notice the bruise in my eye and continued asking us, then why are your things on the ground? Just go pick your things and go straight home okay? Ok Mr. Charles. Goodbye. Bruce said while clinging on my back, You remember this! Good thing the teacher passed by. And left me alone. I am scared to go home, now I am scared to go to school too. Some people think we are just playing but it is not. It is hurting me so much. *** I was about to continue to read the next entry when Kyle entered the room again. What? Youre not finished arranging? Do you need help? I then closed the book and hid it together with the other books that well bring back in the city. Nahh. I was just imagining what you look like when youre just a kid. I said in a happy reply. We then finished off the things we need, said goodbye to the caretaker and left the house just after lunch. I guess its fine for him to not remember those days because of said and depressed things he had experienced as a child. But, I noticed something strange in his behavior when we left the house. Well.. maybe its just my imagination. We arrived at the city and straight to our apartment and had a dinner outside. I took the diary and placed it inside my drawer and noticed that theres a smudge of blood at one edge. I turn the page where the blood stain started and saw the page had more smeared blood stains. Was there something horrible happened when he was writing this entry? I couldnt wait another minute to read it. Kyle then entered our bedroom and said that hell just take a shower before going to bed. I hurriedly sit in couch near the lamp and started reading the entry before that blood smeared page. *** *September 9* I was walking upstairs to grab a paper and pen to draw downstairs. I hear whispers in my older sister, Liz and her boyfriend. The door is slight open and peeped at it. I saw her boyfriend Ryan touching some parts of my sisters body. Liz then refused and told Ryan not to touch her. Ryan suddenly gripped my sisters arms and pushed her in the bed and started kissing her neck as Liz resisting. I had breathed deep and accidentally slightly opened the door. My sister saw me and stopped what Ryan was doing to her. Kyle! Um dont tell ma and pa about this. Were just playing too also okay? Do you need something? I did not answered her and went straight to my room and grabbed what I need to bring downstairs. *** I guess its a little too early for him to see those things and just pretend it only as a joke. I then turn the page and read the blood smeared entry of his diary. The smeared are light so the words were easy to read on but Ill try my best I can to read clearly those. *** *September 11* I bring my diary together at the station. And the police officer asking me questions about what happen. I tell him my story. I was playing with Jessica because the others are out of the house and I got bored on playing the same game. I decided to make a new game. It is called Kill the devil it is like a hide and seek but the other way around. The devil is the hider and the seeker must need to find and kill it. I was the seeker and Jessica is the devil. Jessica said that I need to count until 20 slowly so she can hide secretly. I did so and begin to count. After the count, I started finding Jessica. I know where she is hiding. She is behind the curtain. I secretly grabbed a knife in the kitchen and proceed to the curtain where she is hiding. I tiptoed and as I am near her I shouted, I FOUND THE DEVIL and stabbed her with the knife I am carrying. I saw blood staining out on the curtain and my parents went inside and screamed and asked me what happened. I was still holding the knife and blood flowing through my hands. The police officer asked me, Why did you stabbed your sister? I said to him, We were just playing a hide and seek game and the seeker will kill the devil when he finds her. I do not know what happened and I went back home and write my diary. *** I stared at the diary my dear had written when he was a child. How could he do that? I thought her sister died because of sickness. I was shaking as I was turning some of the pages when I heard the door on the bathroom opened. I hurriedly went straight to bed and put his diary inside my drawer. I saw Kyle staring at me and I asked him whats wrong. Nothing I just suddenly remembered a game I played with my sister Jessica. What was it called? Hmm Im wishing to myself that he wont remember the name of the game. Its a long time ago so you might not remember it. Lets go to sleep now. Its a tiring day we had today. I just said to him to stop remembering the story. Yeah youre right. We both went to sleep. Around 3 in the morning I woked up hearing something metal being scraped on another thing. Turned around to where Kyle is sleeping and notice him standing beside our bed. He was holding a shiny object with his eyes closed. Is.. Is he sleepwalking? He then said to me, Would you like to play with me? Its called Kill the Devil. I was shocked and scared and cover myself with my blanket, grabbed my phone and texted his older sister Liz. I closed my eyes while feeling the bed weighing on and like approaching me. I didnt noticed it was already morning. I saw Kyle, sleeping soundly. Panicking, I searched the places near him if he has something this shiny thing he was holding. There was nothing. Was it a dream? I dont know. It felt so real that I had no time to neither think about others nor call the police. I change my clothes went outside and went to the nearest diner in the apartment. I checked my phone to see if I did sent a text to his sister and I did Im still here at the Diner, waiting for his sisters reply or call. Im too afraid to go to our apartment for I might end up like Jessica. Im also too scared to talk to the police. They might not trust my story. I will try to go to our apartment later after I received Lizs reply.	i learned something about my husband s childhood this was something that happened after we went to my husband s hometown a week ago my husband kyle and i decided to go to his home when he was a child to gather some of his belongings there since no one is living on that house anymore after his parents passed away last year and a caretaker is currently maintaining it we chatted about our lives before we met and he mentioned that he did something when he was a child and didn t remember anything about it maybe an instinct is telling him that he needs to forget about it that it might give a trauma to him when he remembers it it feels like there s a gap of memories when he was a child i didn t ask any questions after that and head to a stop over to have a little quick break we arrived at his hometown around six in the evening and stop by at a mart to buy some dinner we arrive at their house around the caretaker was still awake and had waited for our arrival we had dinner and had a goodnight rest and will start our task the following day the next morning i saw my husband standing at the window having a deep stare outside like a daydreaming thing i said his name kyle ?

Took me 4 bot games to get the combinations down, went into ranked and won 2 games in a row at 3k. He's not super hard.

"You are so wrong. First of all, if you think trying to be like someone who is going through something negative is just ""trying something new"", you have no empathy. You are doing it for yourself. Second, if you think calling someone a war refugee is insulting and outrageous, you are either just being ridiculous or you have no idea what the word war and/or refugee mean. No. You do not need to go through what I am going through to know empathy. You do not need to starve in order to feel for a starving person. You do not need to purposely cut in order to feel for someone who self arms. You do not need to paint yourself black and walk in an all-white neighborhood to know what racism is. You have ears, or eyes, so you can understand what people who go through this EVERY DAY have to say about it. Also, it is NOT a choice for those people. So you choosing to go through it is insulting, because you can just stop whenever. While those people cannot stop. If you need to live something in order to feel empathy, then you're no so empathic. Obviously you won't fully understand something until you go through it yourself, but empathy can be felt without being able to fully relate. I was insulted because you wanted to feel what it's like to live my life 'for fun'. Which, I could tell you. Just ask me! You did it one night, didn't like it, and now you're back to your normal self, like nothing happened. I'm stuck in this miserable life until the day I die. Do you think it's cool to hear about someone who did it ""for fun""?? When I didn't chose it? Really????"	you are so wrong first of all if you think trying to be like someone who is going through something negative is just trying something new you have no empathy you are doing it for yourself second if you think calling someone a war refugee is insulting and outrageous you are either just being ridiculous or you have no idea what the word war and or refugee mean no you do not need to go through what i am going through to know empathy you do not need to starve in order to feel for a starving person you do not need to purposely cut in order to feel for someone who self arms you do not need to paint yourself black and walk in an all white neighborhood to know what racism is you have ears or eyes so you can understand what people who go through this every day have to say about it also it is not a choice for those people so you choosing to go through it is insulting because you can just stop whenever while those people cannot stop if you need to live something in order to feel empathy then you re no so empathic obviously you won t fully understand something until you go through it yourself but empathy can be felt without being able to fully relate i was insulted because you wanted to feel what it s like to live my life for fun which i could tell you just ask me ! you did it one night didn t like it and now you re back to your normal self like nothing happened i m stuck in this miserable life until the day i die do you think it s cool to hear about someone who did it for fun ? ? when i didn t chose it ? really ? ? ? ? 	-0.1399	0.5108	315	1

"you pretty much stop flopping around positions long before you get to 55. That's actually a bad thing. Not that you should flip your position just for the sake of it, but there's also a natural progress in human behavior, and I hope that when I'll be in my 50's I'll still be open to see that's going in the world, what's working and what's not - and adapt accordingly. I don't see any shame in saying ""I used to think like that, but times have changed and I changed my mind"". Better than the opposite."	you pretty much stop flopping around positions long before you get to that s actually a bad thing not that you should flip your position just for the sake of it but there s also a natural progress in human behavior and i hope that when i ll be in my s i ll still be open to see that s going in the world what s working and what s not and adapt accordingly i don t see any shame in saying i used to think like that but times have changed and i changed my mind better than the opposite 	0.0333	0.508	102	0

I understand what you mean. Sometimes, I find myself getting lost in the moment and enjoying myself, but not as often as I'd like at this stage in my recovery. More often than not, everything seems so meaningless, like you said. I guess the only way to try and not feel like this is to do things that shock you into feeling...so doing things outside of your comfort zone. It's what I've had to do a few times...but it doesn't always work :(	i understand what you mean sometimes i find myself getting lost in the moment and enjoying myself but not as often as i d like at this stage in my recovery more often than not everything seems so meaningless like you said i guess the only way to try and not feel like this is to do things that shock you into feeling so doing things outside of your comfort zone it s what i ve had to do a few times but it doesn t always work sad 	-0.0953	0.5125	89	1

We had a teacher who wanted to be a nun but was rejected (they can do that), and she would flip people's desks all the time and threaten them. The verbal abuse her students endured was insane, but she was an old woman so the school never did anything about it. It was also a small Catholic school, so a lot of shit like that went down that none of the kids were mature enough to realize was bad and none of the adults bothered to correct.	we had a teacher who wanted to be a nun but was rejected they can do that and she would flip people s desks all the time and threaten them the verbal abuse her students endured was insane but she was an old woman so the school never did anything about it it was also a small catholic school so a lot of shit like that went down that none of the kids were mature enough to realize was bad and none of the adults bothered to correct 	-0.234	0.51	88	1

Bad source. The formaldehyde issue and the nitrosamines issues are inaccurate. Formaldehyde is even less of an issue now that the DNA40 is out with temperature control, but they won't cover that. They also wouldn't cover that in a study, propylene glycol mist had a 100% success rate of killing the influenza virus. But no, focus on MRSA. Who the fuck has that anymore.	bad source the formaldehyde issue and the issues are inaccurate formaldehyde is even less of an issue now that the is out with temperature control but they won t cover that they also wouldn t cover that in a study propylene glycol mist had a success rate of killing the influenza virus but no focus on mrsa who the fuck has that anymore 	-0.2417	0.617	63	1

"Had a very bad breakdown/anxiety attack in school today. Long and heart wrenching story short, my bestfriend, who was my boyfriend for a very long time up until he tried to kill himself a month ago and came back saying he wanted a break because he might be gay. Well, today, walking to lunch, I saw him holding this girl M's hand... I don't know what came over me, but I screamed ""I can't! No!"" and ran into the bathroom, where coincidentally my best friend Chloe had been. I started screaming and crying and, apparently, I said ""I just want to die"" a few times. M, who has actually been making mine and his life a living hell for months, came in and started yelling at me, saying ""What the fuck is wrong? Is it because w were holding hands? He's gay, get over it!"" and I just died inside at that point, because, if he really is gay, I'm losing everything I had at one point, indefinitely. I guess I kept asking her to stop but she wouldn't so Chloe made her leave, and while Chloe was gone, I threw up all over myself while I cried. A counselor came in and took me to the office where my favorite teacher (guy. funny. suffers from anxiety and depression) let me just vent, since he knows everything I have gone through with bestfriend/boyfriend person. I had to write an incident report because of what Madison did and shit. I got calmed down and when I finally started walking back to class, I saw M with bestfriend/boyfriend's beanie... I died a little and went to class with tears in my eyes, as always. After that class ended, I went to bestfriend/boyfriend- let's start calling him J- and said ""I don't think you mean to, but you're breaking my heart."" and he just looked at me and said he was sorry, and explained him and M have nothing going on at all, and he just held her hand for a moment to calm her down. I explained how awful it is, since I used to mean everything to him and now I feel like I mean nothing at all to him. He said, and I quote ""I never meant to push anyone out, especially not you. You still mean a lot to me. Like, a lot, I just..."" I then said ""Do we have a chance anymore, J?"" to which he responded to by shrugging and saying ""I don't know."" and then he gave me a hug and I whispered ""I'm sorry"" into his neck and he just gave me the saddest look I've ever seen and went into art textiles... I know he really doesn't know. He's not saying it because he doesn't have the guts to say no. He's just extremely fucking confused with everything at the moment. This is the first time since he got back that I've actually expressed that this is effecting me negatively, and I didn't even really express it to him. Two of our friends are going to talk to him about this tomorrow, because they are both quite pissed about the way he's handling this, especially after today... I miss what I had, and I don't know why I feel so broken. I really just want to die, to be honest. It would feel a lot better than this... I'm cutting again, I've stopped taking my meds... I just... I've been suffering in silence for a month. Today, I broke that silence, but in the wrong way, and to the wrong person...

You have given an uncharitable characterization of what I have said, and then argued against that characterization. Most people are anti-drug (in that they reject hard drugs and endorse their illegality), and most people are ambivalent about bitcoin (in that they are unfamiliar with it). It would be a good thing if this sub had some decent answers for those people. If I were anti-drug and knew nothing about bitcoin, and voiced my concerns about bitcoin and drug crime on here, I would expect to be turned away and not have my concerns taken seriously. That would leave me with a bad impression of bitcoin.	you have given an characterization of what i have said and then argued against that characterization most people are anti drug in that they reject hard drugs and endorse their illegality and most people are ambivalent about bitcoin in that they are unfamiliar with it it would be a good thing if this sub had some decent answers for those people if i were anti drug and knew nothing about bitcoin and voiced my concerns about bitcoin and drug crime on here i would expect to be turned away and not have my concerns taken seriously that would leave me with a bad impression of bitcoin 	0.0774	0.4323	106	0
